Another perspective suggests that 'Adeemul Arz' refers specifically to the fourth layer of the earth.\n",

It has sweet, sour tastes, agreeable and disagree-\" This indicates that Adam, and by extension all of humanity, was created from a diverse collection of earth, reflecting the vast array of colors, temperaments, and qualities found within humankind.\n",

One of his questions\\nconcerned the logic behind the sending of Prophets.\\nThe Imam said, “When we have agreed that we have a Maker and\\nCreator; who is higher than His creatures and absolutely free from the\\nfact that His creatures can see Him, touch Him or converse with Him; we\\nunderstand that the Maker is Wise. He only does that which is beneficial\\nto His creatures. Then it is necessary to send Prophets and Messengers\\nwho would communicate His laws to the people. They would guide the\\npeople in the affairs that are beneficial and (prevent them from) those\\nthat cause everlasting perdition.\\nConsequently, it is evident that there must be a particular group,\\nwhich would convey His message to the people. They are the chosen\\nones of Allah and His Prophets. They are wise and intelligent. The\\nAlmighty has bestowed them with wisdom and knowledge and appoin-\\nted them as His Messengers.\\nTheir circumstances and characteristics were quite different from those\\nof the common people though in their creation and method they are like\\nordinary human beings. However, they are sent by Allah, the Wise and\\nthe Omniscient, with knowledge, wisdom, arguments, proofs, witnesses\\nand miracles so that they may prove the veracity of their claims.\\nLike raising of the dead and curing of the blind and lepers etc, they ac-\\ncomplished some tasks that were impossible for ordinary people.

And they may achieve an everlasting life so that people\\nmay learn about their Lord what they did not know. They must recog-\\nnize Allah as their Cherisher and they confess to His Oneness.\\nAnother reliable report mentions that Fadhl ibn Shadhan asked Ja‘far\\nas-Sadiq “When it is obligatory for people to obey the Prophets, why are\\nthey also required to recognize them and to confess to their truth?”\\nImam replied, “This is because the creatures did not have the ability to\\nunderstand their wisdom fully. Their creator was much higher that He\\ncould be perceived by sight. The inability to understand His Divine\\nEssence was apparent. There was no choice except to appoint Prophets\\nas links between people and Allah. This infallible Prophet conveyed the\\ndivine commands and prohibitions to the people. He also had to keep\\nthe people firm on some affairs whereby they could obtain the benefits\\nand be safe from the perils, because the people cannot decide by their\\nown intellects what is beneficial for them and what is harmful. If the\\nobedience and recognition of Prophets had not been incumbent on\\npeople, the sending of Prophets would have been a useless venture. And\\nthe wise One, who had created everything with untold benefits, is pure\\nfrom such vain acts.”\\nRelated through reliable chains of narrators is the report where Abu-\\nBasir asked Ja‘faras-Sadiq the reason why Allah has bestowed miracles\\non the Prophets and Imams. The Imam replied, “So that the veracity of\\ntheir claims is established. Because miracles are from Allah, the\\nAlmighty, He gives them to His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs so that\\nthe truth of the truthful ones and the lie of the liars are proved.”\\n7', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Allah never calls\\nanyone towards disbelief.”\\nThen the questioner asked if Allah changes the heart of a confirmed\\ndisbeliever from disbelief to belief. The Imam said: “Allah has created\\neveryone with a capacity to believe.

And in this way, argument could be exhausted for the people.\\nThus some people receive guidance (faith) by Allah’stawfiq (guidance)\\nand some do not achieve guidance.”\\nIt is narrated in an authentic report that Ibn al-Sikkit asked Imam al-\\nRidha or Imam ‘Ali al-Naqi why Allah sent Musa[1]\\n(Prophet Moses) with a luminous arm, the Staff and other things to\\ncounter magic, ‘Isa (Prophet Jesus) with a miracle resembling medical\\ncure and Muhammad al-Mustafa (the Chosen) with an eloquent speech\\nand learned dialogue. Imam replied: “Magic was the prevailing science\\nduring the time of Musa. Musa brought miracles resembling magic but\\nmuch more powerful.

These divine personages are granted immunity from minor sins.\\nThey do not commit any sin, knowingly, unknowingly nor in forgetful-\\nness; neither before their appointment as Prophets nor afterwards;\\nneither in childhood nor in old age. No scholar has disagreed on this ex-\\ncept Ibn Babawayh and Shaykh Abu-Muhammad bin al-Husayn bin al-\\nWalid.

Many of the traditions regarding the infallibility of Prophets\\nwill be quoted in our discussion on Imamate (Vol. 3). However, we\\npresent a few traditions that shall suffice for our discussion.\\n1) Firstly, the Prophets are sent to people with the intention that\\npeople obey them and act upon the divine prohibitions and commands.\\nHence, if Allah does not make them infallible it would not serve the pur-\\npose and it does not befit a Wise one to do something vain. The Prophets\\nare sent with a message for the people to act righteously and to abstain\\nfrom evil. So, the Prophets first have to practice what they preach to oth-\\ners. How else could their exhortations be effective. This can be illustrated\\nby the example of some preachers and prayer leaders.\\nIn case people find them lacking in high morals and having weakness\\nto minor detestable acts, they do not follow them. So what would hap-\\npen if these leaders commit sins like adultery, murder and drinking etc?\\nThe majority sect allows that a Prophet or his legatee can commit some\\nminor sins. Some eight to ten sins are included in this. Even these people\\nare of the opinion that a person who commits sins like omitting the Pray-\\ners and fasting, sexual perversion, listening to songs and useless games\\nis not worthy of the rulership of Muslim community and caliphate.

On the other hand, it\\nis wrong to prevent a Prophet from doing anything because it is as-\\nsumed that he does everything with Allah’s permission.

Imam said that they were liars. “Was Allah incap-\\nable of creating her other than from Adam’s rib?” The narrator said,\\n“May I be your ransom, then how did Allah create her?”\\n“My father has quoted my forefathers and they in turn report that the\\nMessenger of Allah said, “The Almighty took a handful of dust and by\\nHis power created Adam and from the leftover of the same dust He cre-\\nated Hawwa’.”\\nBoth Shi‘ahas well as Sunni scholars have recorded the tradition from\\nWahab bin Munabbah which says that Allah created Hawwa’from the\\nleftovers of the clay in the same form and while Adam was made to go to\\nsleep and dream, he was shown Hawwa’.It was the first dream that oc-\\ncurred to people on the earth. When Adam awoke he saw Hawwa’near\\nhis head. The Almighty revealed, “O Adam Who is sitting near you?”\\n“She is the same one I saw in my dream,” replied Adam.\\nIt is related through authentic channels that a Jew came to Amir al-\\nMu’minin ‘Ali and asked him why Adam was named Adam and\\nHawwa’ as Hawwa’?\\n52', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

He asked, “Was it due to the lofty\\nposition of Muhammad that Almighty Allah ordered the angels to pros-\\ntrate before Adam?”\\n‘Alisaid, “That’sright. But their prostrations were not those of wor-\\nship. The Angels did not worship Adam. Their prostration was an ac-\\nknowledgement of respect for Adam due to his extraordinary virtues.”\\nIt was Divine Mercy for Adam that was bestowed through\\nMuhammad who was superior to him. Indeed, the Almighty Allah sent\\nbenedictions upon them in His heavenly Majesty and all the Angels fol-\\nlowed suit. The believers were also commanded to recite Salawaat for\\nthem. Thus his status was higher than that of Adam himself.\\nAuthentic chains quote Imam al-Ridha from his ancestors from Amir\\nal-Mu’minin‘Alithat the Holy Prophet said, “The Almighty Allah has\\nexalted His Prophets and Messengers over the Angels, and He is has ex-\\nalted me over the other Prophets and Messengers. And after me you ‘Ali\\nand the Imams from your progeny have been exalted over the other\\npeople. Then he said, “The Almighty Allah created Adam and entrusted\\nus to his backbone. Then Allah commanded the Angels to bow down as\\na mark of respect. But their prostration denoted Allah’s worship and\\nobedience and an acknowledgement of Adam’sexalted position. It was a\\nSajdah of obedience because we were in his (Adam’s)loins. Thus how\\ncould we not be superior to the Angels?

One of their questions\\nwas why Muslims are obliged to pray five times a day? The Messenger\\nof Allah said, “Because when Adam ate from the forbidden tree it was\\nthe time of Asr. Allah sent him to the earth and made the prayers of Asr\\ncompulsory for Adam’schildren until the Resurrection Day. And Allah\\nordered the Muslim community to keep up this prayer. Thus it is my fa-\\nvorite prayer. I have been ordered to establish it. When the repentance of\\nAdam was accepted it was Maghrib. At that time Adam recited three\\nRak’ahs(units). One for his mistake, one for that of Hawwa’’sand the\\nthird for the acceptance his apology. Allah made these Rak’ahscompuls-\\nory for my people. There was a gap of 300 years (of Earth) from the time\\nAdam tasted the fruit and when Allah forgave him. A day of the Here-\\nafter is equal to one thousand years of the Earth.”[22]\\nThe Jews asked, “Why does Wudhu’involve the particular four parts\\nof the body that are clean most of the time?” Prophet said, “When Satan\\ndeceived Adam he went to the tree and became disgraced. He ate with\\nhis hands and his heavenly dress separated from his body. He put his\\nhands on his head and wept. When Allah accepted his repentance He\\nasked him to wash the face because he had first looked towards the tree.\\nThen to wash his hands as he picked the fruit by them. Then He ordered\\nhim to anoint his head as he had put them on the head and ordered him\\nto anoint on the feet because he used them first for disobeying His com-\\nmand. Thus we perform Wudhu’ in this way.” They asked why Allah\\nmade thirty fasts compulsory. Prophet answered, “Because the fruit re-\\nmained in his stomach for thirty days. Allah made thirty fasts incumbent\\non Adam and his children. But it is His grace that He allowed them to\\neat before sunrise.

Satan came and asked her\\ncondition. Hawwa’told him that previously a child was born who died\\nin six days. Satan said, “If you had made an intention to name him Ab-\\ndul Haris he wouldn’t have died. Now you shall beget an animal like\\ncamel, cow, sheep or goat.” Hawwa’ decided to believe him and she\\nmentioned it to Adam. Adam also thought the same thing.

The Almighty\\nAllah taught Adam the names of his progeny and informed him of their exalted\\nstatus. Then Allah presented the Holy lights (Noor) of the Prophets and their legatees\\nto the Angels. He asked the Angels if they knew their names and qualities. When the\\nAngels confessed their ignorance Allah appointed Adam to teach them the names\\nand qualities of these benevolent personalities.\\n129', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Allah proved their ignorance in the matter. It\\nwas only after Adam had mentioned their names did they realize that among the\\nprogeny of Adam were many personalities more deserving of Allah’s Caliphate.\\n6.Secondly the Almighty removed the misconception the Angels had harboured\\nabout themselves. They thought they were unsurpassable in piety and praising Al-\\nlah. They could not even imagine that a person like Iblis was also one of them. Hence\\nanother fact became clear for them.\\n7.It must be clarified that there is a difference of opinion between two schools of\\nthoughts as far as the absolute infallibility of Angels is concerned. According to\\nShi‘ahs the infallibility of Angels is proved beyond any doubt according to Qur’anic\\nAyats and traditions of Masoomeen Furthermore their questioning Allah’s decision\\nwas not an act of arrogance and they knew very well that Allah shall do whatever is\\nbest. Yet they questioned him to know the wisdom it.\\n8.Such a type of questioning falls under the category of Tark al-Awla, therefore it\\ndidn’t harm the infallibility of the Angels.\\n9.There is also a difference of opinion among the Shi‘ah and Sunni Commentators\\nregarding the names taught to Adam. According to some, Adam was taught the\\nnames of things in various languages. The children of Adam learnt the various lan-\\nguages from him. When they separated, each of them spoke the language he liked\\nbest. Due to the passage of time each of the languages diverged from each other.\\nSome more traditions on this topic shall be quoted in the forthcoming discussion.\\n10.There is also a group that interprets ‘names’ to mean rights, obligations and origins\\nof different things. For example, the creation of water, making of the earth, prescrip-\\ntions of medicines and diets, mining of metals, and all things concerned with life and\\nhereafter.\\n11.The experts also think that both these meanings are general. And the last interpret-\\nation is the summary of all varying traditions.\\n12.People may object that the superiority of Adam was due to the fact that Allah\\ntaught him the names beforehand whereas He didn’t teach the Angels. So it was an\\nunequal match. The reply to this is that Allah might have taught Adam in front of the\\nAngels but they were unable to grasp the meaning whereas Adam could.\\n13.There are many aspects to this problem and it is beyond the scope of this book to\\nmention them all. The interpretation of Imam is not in need of detailed explanations.\\n(i.e.. It is self - explanatory.)\\n14.This view is supported by two narrations of Ja’far al-Sadiq wherein he says,\\n15.“The Almighty Allah taught Adam the names of all His Proofs that were in the\\nspiritual form at that time. Then He presented them to the Angels. Allah asked the\\nAngels to name them to support their claim of superiority over Adam in the matter\\nof Divine vicegerency. The Angels said,\\n16.“They said: Glory be to Thee! we have no knowledge but that which Thou hast\\ntaught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise.” (Surah Baqarah 2:32)\\n130', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Allah Commanded the\\nAngels to cultivate love and devotion of these luminaries.\\n19.Allah then said, “Did I not say that I was having knowledge of whatever is hidden\\nin the Earth and the heavens, and whatever you manifest and hide?’\\n20.\\n21.[14] The splendor of Allah could denote the light of recognition that Allah de-\\nprived the Angels; that they had previously possessed. It could mean the light of His\\nGreatness and Glory that was manifested in the Holy Throne and the curtains.\\n22.\\n23.[15] All the Muslims agree that the Sajdah of Angels to Adam’s was not a Sajdah of\\ndeification. Because Sajdah for anyone other than Allah is Polytheism and Disbelief.\\nThere are three opinions regarding this Sajdah. First: The Sajdah was for Almighty\\nAllah and Adam was just a Kiblah. Just as people face the Ka‘bah during prayers.\\nThe first traditions proves this point. Second: The word ‘Sajdah’ indicates honoring\\nor paying respect and not the Sajdah in the literal sense. Although the former is in\\nconsonance with the dictionary meaning but most of the traditions disprove it. Third:\\nThe Sajdah to respect Adam was actually the Sajdah of Allah’s worship. Because Al-\\nlah had ordered it. This point is also stated in the majority of tradition.\\n24.Thus it proves that doing Sajdah for anyone else other than Allah with the inten-\\ntion of worship is infidelity. It is a sin if Allah had not commanded it. Although there\\nis a possibility that Sajdah of respect was permitted in previous nations but it is em-\\nphatically stated to be haram for this Ummah. A number of traditions to this effect\\nhave been recorded and as mentioned below.\\n25.\\n26.[16] There are different views regarding Iblis, some which are erroneous. First of\\nall they have considered greatness as the root. Secondly Prophet Adam’s excellence is\\nconcerned with his soul because ‘noor’ is a basis of all things. And the ‘noor’ of\\nAdam was imbued with divine recognition and knowledge. Both these things are be-\\nstowed to Allah’s beloved people. And the fire’s luminosity is imperfect. It depends\\nhow much it is beneficial; if anyone goes near it, it destroys him. Fire burns to ashes.\\nIn comparison, Adam’s brilliance is different. Thirdly, Satan thought fire is better\\nthan dust and this was his mistake. He thought all attributes of fire are beneficial. Al-\\nlah granted a temporary brightness to fire and it became proud, so Allah the Su-\\npreme, disgraced it. Allah bestowed the dust with superiority. He grew tasty fruits\\nand vegetables from it. It became useful to all mankind and was bestowed with nat-\\nural power. Its inherent qualities were concealed in the earth. The dust was taken to\\nthe Holy Throne and exalted. The kings and ordinary persons all are ultimately bur-\\nied in it.\\n27.\\n131', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

He had already been expelled from heaven whereas Adam and Hawwa’\\nresided. According to some scholars, Adam and Hawwa’ came up to the entrance of\\nheaven and the Satan also had access until there. And he used to speak to them from\\noutside. Some have stated that Satan wrote an anonymous letter to them. According\\nto another view when Satan tried to enter the Garden he was prevented by the\\nguards. So he approached in turn all the animals of Paradise but they all refused to\\ngain him entry. At last he came to the serpent and said, “I swear, I will remove your\\nbaneful effect from the son of Adam and you will remain in my protection. Now take\\nme inside the Garden.” The serpent asked him to sit between his two fangs and\\nsmuggled him into Paradise. At that time the body of the serpent was covered. He\\nhad four limbs and was much better in appearance than other animals. He was as tall\\nas a camel. When he brought Satan into Paradise, Allah became angry and stripped\\nhim down and cut off his hands and legs. From that day the serpents crawl on the\\nearth because they helped Satan to enter the Garden in contravention of divine\\ncommand.\\n29.\\n30.[18] There are many different views about the administration of divine justice. It is\\npossible that Allah created Prophet Adam for the Earth and not for the heaven.\\n31.\\n32.[19] There are different views regarding the tree which was forbidden by Allah.\\nSome say it was a fig tree and for some it was a grapevine and some others say it was\\na camphor tree. Shaykh al-Tusi has narrated from Imam ‘Ali that it was a tree of\\nsecret knowledge and death and the same Imam has mentioned that it was an eternal\\ntree from which the angels eat and acquire immortality.\\n33.We have already proved that Prophets are infallible. Jealousy is a sin and a Proph-\\net can never commit a sin. Here it must be clarified that jealousy implies a desire that\\nthe recipient of bounty should lose it. Whereas it was obvious that Adam had already\\nlearnt of the high status of the family of Muhammad and could never have wished\\nthem to lose the Divine Bounty. Thus it was not exactly ‘jealousy’. Hence, at the most\\nit could be said to be Makrooh (detestable) orTark al-Awla (Leaving the preferable\\noption).\\n34.\\n35.[20] There are some differences regarding the Paradise of Adam. Whether it is on\\nthe earth or in the heavens? Is it the same that the virtuous people will enter or some\\nother? The writers of Qur’anic exegesis agree that it was one of the gardens of heav-\\nen. The others say that it was a garden of the earth and from the same tradition have\\nstated that one who enters once never comes out. Regarding this people say that due\\nto the good deeds a person will enter in the heaven and will not come out. But it is a\\ndoubtful matter. For example, Prophet Muhammad al-Mustafa ’s flight to the heav-\\nens and back. The angels also come and go. Besides this, there are different opinions\\nabout it. In most traditions it is stated that the Paradise of Adam was on the heavens.\\n36.\\n37.[21] The text of this hadith is same as those quoted above so we refrain from\\nrepetition.\\n38.\\n132', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Many reliable traditions shows Adam came down to Safa and Marwa. And\\nsome traditions say that they came down to India.

His height may have been reduced by 70 hands. That is previously he was 70\\nhands and tall and subsequently reduced to one unit it might refer to the unit ‘hand’\\nof that time or the unit that which Adam fixed for measurement of things.

The angels, Prophet and the truthful ones will say that it can-\\nnot be anyone except the closest angel and a Messenger who has been\\nsent by Allah. At this occasion a voice shall call out, “This is not a prox-\\nimate angel, nor a Messenger, it is the brother of the Messenger of Allah,\\nin the world and hereafter, it is ‘Ali Ibn Abi-Talib.”\\nAccording to authentic tradition, people asked Imam Al-Hasan about\\nthe seven creatures that did not come through the womb.\\nImam Al-Hasan said, “They are Adam, Hawwa’,the ram of Ibrahim,\\nthe she-camel of Salih, serpent of the Garden of Eden, the crow that was\\nsent by Allah to teach Habil the method of burial and Iblis (Curse of Al-\\nlah be upon him.).”\\nIt is recorded in some traditions that when they had cut off the legs of\\nshe-camel the same nine persons said, “Come, let us kill Salih too. For if\\nhe had given a correct prediction of chastisement, we would have killed\\nhim beforehand. If he is wrong we would have sent him where we sent\\nthe she-camel.” After hatching the plot, they came to the house of Salih\\nin the dark of the night.

Five of them related to the\\nhead and five to the body. The five with regard to head are: Trimming of\\nmustache, beard, pruning the hair, brushing of teeth, and picking of\\nteeth. Five actions are related to the body:\\nShaving of pubic hair, circumcision, trimming of nails, ritual bath\\n(after sexual intercourse) and purification with water after passing urine.\\nThese are the upright practices of Ibrahim which shall remain in force\\nuntil the Resurrection Day. This is the meaning of Allah’swords: Follow\\nthe religion of Ibrahim. Because it is the correct method to move from the\\nfalse religion towards the true faith.\\n210', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Ibrahim\\nleft them at this place and returned weeping.\\nAl-Qutb al-Rawandi says that when Isma‘ilreached maturity he col-\\nlected seven goats. That was all that he possessed. His facial hair was in\\nabundance. He spoke Arabic and was an expert archer. After the demise\\nof his mother, he married a woman from the tribe of Jurham. She was\\nnamed Zahla or Amawa. Later he divorced her. He did not have any\\nchild from her. After that he married Sayyada the daughter of Harith bin\\nQass. From this wife he had many sons. His total life span was of 137\\nyears and he was buried in Hijr Isma‘il.\\nAuthentic chain of traditionalists state that according to Imam Ja‘far\\nas-Sadiq the age of Isma‘ilwas 130 years.

When the\\nsun arose they left for ‘Arafat,reached Marwa and halted there. At the\\ntime of Zawaal, they prayed Zuhr and Asr with one Azaan but with dif-\\nferentIqamah, at the spot where the Masjid of ‘Arafat is situated.\\nThen he made him stand in an empty space and told him to repent for\\nhis sins.

As a result, the\\nAlmighty sent for him the garment and ring and ordered the “Be Cool O!\\nFire.”\\n[56] It is well-known among the historians that Nimrod was also\\nseated with his personal assistant in the box.\\n[57] This part contains some controversial points and even though he\\nhas explained them in Behaarul Anwaar, it is necessary to mention them\\nhere also. The apparent meaning of the ayats is that Azar was the father\\nof Ibrahim and the same is well-known among Sunnis. However, it is\\nfamous or rather a unanimous opinion of the Shi‘ahscholars that Tarukh\\nand not Azar was the father of Ibrahim. And the Tarukh was a Muslim.\\nThe greatest scholars of Shi‘ahshave defended this opinion by the tradi-\\ntions that all the ancestors of the Holy Prophet until Adam were Mono-\\ntheists. They were also either Prophets or their legatees. Since Ibrahim is\\none of the ancestors of the Holy Prophet it is necessary that his father\\nmust be a Muslim too. The genealogists also agree that Ibrahim’sfather\\nwas Tarukh. Therefore whenever the Qur’anor hadith mention Azar as\\nthe father of Ibrahim, it is only a metaphor because he was the uncle of\\nIbrahim Referring to ones Uncle as father is an Arabian custom. It is also\\npossible that Azar was Ibrahim’suncle and after his father’sdeath mar-\\nried Ibrahim’smother. Since he brought up Ibrahim under his care, he is\\nreferred to as his father.

Then he broke\\nthe idols. Why did he make such a statement? Was it true or false? Ac-\\ncording to some Ibrahim had intermittent fever and thus looked at the\\nstars and said, “It is the time for my repentance, I will be having fever\\nand hence cannot go out. Others say that since the people were practi-\\ntioners of astrology, Ibrahim also studied the stars before stating that he\\nhad fever, whether truly or just as an excuse. Because an untrue state-\\nment can be spoken as an allusion. With the intention of a true state-\\nment, it can be spoken as toriya. It is not considered a lie and is permiss-\\nible. Rather in some demanding circumstances, it becomes obligatory to\\nward off danger to ones life or property. Some scholars have also ex-\\nplained the ayah in a way that Ibrahim looked at the stars, that are cre-\\nated by Allah and said that he was sick of the fact that people should\\nworship the stars and idols. The apparent meaning of some authentic\\ntradition shows that the statement of Ibrahim was spoken for some spe-\\ncial reason.

Secondly, though it was an assertion it\\ncould be construed as an assumption. Moreover, Ibrahim said this be-\\ncause if he had right away testified to Allah’soneness the people might\\nhave abandoned him right away without allowing him to complete the\\nproof. So he sought their support in the beginning and then proved that\\nit cannot be so. This convinced the people. Lending support to this argu-\\nment is the tradition of Imam Ja’faral-Sadiq that he said the statement of\\nIbrahim was not his own but what people used to believe. He only re-\\npeated it.\\nThirdly, the words of Ibrahim can be rhetorical. This is saying the op-\\nposite of what he means.\\nAl-Ma’munasked Imam al-Ri€a the exegesis of the same ayah. Imam\\nsaid, “At that time there were three kinds of people. Some worshipped\\nVenus, some worshipped the moon and some deified the Sun. When\\nIbrahim came out of the cave where he was hidden since birth, the Sun\\nhad already set and Venus shone on the sky. He made a rhetorical state-\\nment, it was not an assertion. After Venus set he said, ‘Ido not like those\\nwho set. Because setting and receding into concealment is a sign of a\\ntemporal being. It is not a sign of permanence and omniscience.’Then he\\nlooked at the luminous moon and said by way of rhetoric, ‘Thisis my\\nLord?’When it has also set, he said, ‘Ifmy Lord had not guided me I\\nwould have gone astray.’Imam says, “He meant to say that if he had not\\nbeen in the guidance of Almighty he would have been among the\\ninfidels.”\\nWhen it was morning and the sun arose. Ibrahim said by way of rhet-\\noric, ‘Is this my Lord? For it is larger than Venus and larger than the\\nMoon.’\\nWhen the Sun also set, he addressed the three groups and said, “O\\npeople! Keep away from those whom you associate with Allah. I have\\nturned my face towards the One who originated the heavens and the\\nearths. I am sincere in dissociating from all false beliefs. I am not a\\npolytheist.”\\nIt is also possible that Ibrahim intended to convince the people of the\\nfallacy of worshipping objects that had temporal characteristics of the\\nVenus, Moon and Sun. Whereas the one who deserved to be worshipped\\nis the one who created the heavens and the earth. The arguments that\\nIbrahim employed were revealed to him by the Almighty Himself.

And those four kings\\nhave reigned over the entire earth. Two of them were believers: Sulay-\\nman and Dhu’l-Qarnaynand the other two were infidels: Nebuchadnez-\\nzar and Nimrod. Nimrod was informed that a male child was to be born\\nthat year. He would destroy him, his religion and his idols.\\nAfter securing this information, he appointed female spies for expect-\\nant ladies and ordered all newborn boys to be killed that year. The moth-\\ner of Ibrahim was also pregnant that year. The Almighty fixed the foetus\\nof Ibrahim of the back of his mother instead of the belly. When he was\\nborn, his mother hid him in a cave below the surface of the earth and\\nclosed the entrance. He grew up unlike other children and his mother\\nvisited him occasionally. Thus, when he came out of the cave for the first\\ntime, he saw Venus shining on the sky. He had not seen a more beautiful\\nstar. “This is my Lord,” said he. The Moon arose after some time. When\\nIbrahim saw the moon, he said, “It is bigger.

Moreover, there are\\nsome other reasons that I have explained in Behaarul Anwaar.\\nIbrahim’sstatement upon the disappearance of Venus that he did not\\nconsider it as his Lord is significant for the fact that when a star rises, it is\\nmore luminous and bright but at the time of setting it loses its luster and\\nbecomes dull. Therefore, the people used to worship it at the time it\\narose. Ibrahim wanted to point out the fallacy of the people in worship-\\nping something that is inconsistent. One should worship only that which\\nis ever-present and able to benefit its creatures, without any conditions\\nattached. Something that is constant in bestowing benefits. Also, that\\nsomething which is subject to change is itself temporal. It is also possible\\nthat Ibrahim wanted to call their attention towards this particular phe-\\nnomena because they were aware of the effect of the Star at the time of\\nits rising and knew that it weakens by the time it is setting.

For it is a lie and a\\nProphet can never lie. This doubt can also be explained in a number of\\nways:\\nFirst of all the statement of Ibrahim was conditional because he\\nsaid, “The biggest of them did it. Ask them if they can talk.” (Surah An-\\nbiya 21:63). It means that if they were capable of talking and deserving of\\nworship they could have performed such an action. Actually, it was a\\ngreat insult to the idols. That those who cannot talk and cannot protect\\nthemselves and neither cause benefit nor harm, then how foolish it is to\\nworship them.\\nAccordingly when Ja’faral-Sadiq was asked for the tafsir of this ayah\\nhe said, “Ibrahim said, “If they could talk” at the conclusion of his state-\\nment. It means that if they can talk, the largest one has done it. Other-\\nwise not.” Hence Ibrahim did not make a false statement.” Secondly, ac-\\ncusing the largest idol for the act was metaphor. Ibrahim had broken the\\nidols because the people venerated them. Since they respected the largest\\nidol more, it was entitled to greater blame. It is common in Arabic lan-\\nguage to associate the verb with something other then the doer of the\\naction.\\nThirdly, ‘the biggest of them’ is the second phrase of the ayah, pro-\\nceeded by ‘hehas done it’.The first phrase could mean ‘onewho did it,\\nhe has done it’.“If what you say is true that they are gods, the biggest of\\nthem is present, ask him who did it.”\\n74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96\\n74.Fourthly, falsehood is a statement that is against reality and bereft of any wisdom.\\nIbrahim said that for hidden wisdom, to defeat the people in logical reasoning. Ac-\\ncordingly, there is an authentic tradition from Ja’far al-Sadiq that a person who says\\nsomething untrue for the sake of correcting someone cannot be blamed for lying.\\nThen Imam recited the above ayah and said, “By Allah! The idols didn’t do it and\\nneither Ibrahim uttered a lie.” And in another tradition Imam says, “Allah likes the\\nlie that is uttered like Ibrahim for reforming the people. He said, ‘He had done it, the\\nbiggest of them,’ for educating the people.

This controversy can be cleared in a number of ways. First, he\\nwanted to see the actual process though he believed in it. When some people asked\\nImam al-Ri€a, “Was Ibrahim in doubt when he said, But that may be at ease?” Imam\\nreplied, “No, he was not in doubt, but he wanted to increase his faith in the\\nAlmighty.” Imam Musa al-Ka¨im has also explained in the same way.\\n79.Second: Though he believed in the raising of dead, he wanted to witness the pro-\\ncess with his own eyes.\\n80.Third: As mentioned in a tradition mentioned above, he wanted to be sure he was\\nthe appointed ‘Khalil.;\\n81.Fourth: That Nimrod had challenged him to enliven the dead and warned him of\\ndire consequences if he didn’t. So Ibrahim desired to obtain his hearts’ ease and also\\ncomply with Nimrod’s challenge. But only two of the reasons are mostly likely ones.\\nAnd Shaykh Muhammad bin Babawayh has related that Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah\\nbin Tayfoor told me regarding the ayah. “O Lord show me how your enliven the\\ndead,” that the Almighty told Ibrahim to visit one of his exalted servants. When\\nIbrahim paid him a visit he said that there is a person by the name of Ibrahim and the\\nAlmighty has taken him as His Khalil. Ibrahim asked what was the proof of this. The\\nman replied, “Allah will enliven the dead for him.”\\n82.Ibrahim suspected that he himself was that Khalil, and to make sure requested Al-\\nlah to give life to the dead. The Almighty asked him if no faith had in it. He replied\\nthat he had faith but wished to put his heart at ease. (that I am that Khalil) He also\\nwished to have miracle as the other Prophets had. So he requested the Almighty to\\nraise the dead to life. The Almighty ordered him to kill a living being. Ibrahim\\nslaughtered his son Isma‘il. The Almighty ordered him to slaughter four birds: Pea-\\ncock, pigeon, wild duck and a cock:\\n83.Peacock symbolized the embellishments of this world, pigeon stood for the in-\\ncreasing hopes, for it had a long life-span, the wild duck indicated jealousy and the\\ncock was a symbol of sensuality. So the Almighty told him that if he wished to en-\\nliven his heart and put it to ease he must purify his heart from the four things and\\nkill them by his self. Because even if one of them remains in the heart, it cannot be at\\nease. The Shaykh says that he asked him as to why the Almighty asked him, “Do you\\nnot believe?” When He was aware that Ibrahim was a believer. Muhammad bin\\n‘Abdullah replied, “Because the request of Ibrahim apparently indicated doubt. And\\nthe Almighty wished to clear him of all blame. So Ibrahim said that he was not it\\ndoubt but wanted to strengthen his faith. Or other reasons as mentioned above.\\n84.Since the words of Ibn Tayfoor are not hadith they cannot be relied upon like we\\nrely on authentic traditions. But since the Shaykh has mentioned them, I too quote\\nthe same.\\n85.\\n241', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

But the\\npeople rejected his call and refused to obey him.\\nConsequently when Allah wished to send down His wrath upon them\\nHe first dispatched His messengers (angels) in order to warn the people\\nand exhaust all arguments. The people flourished economically but their\\nsins increased, so Allah commanded the angels to evacuate all the believ-\\ners from Lut’s city. But they did not find any except a single Muslim\\nhousehold. They were shifted out of town. The angels then told Lut to\\ntake away with him this family during the night. After midnight Lut set\\nout with his daughters. His wife rushed to her people to inform them of\\nLut’sflight. When the sun arose the next day the Almighty ordered: “O\\nArchangel Gabriel!

When Yusuf was a child he\\nlived with his aunt (father’ssister). She adored him much. Ishaq had a\\nwaistband that he had given to Ya‘qub.This waistband was in the pos-\\nsession of Ya‘qub’ssister. When Ya‘qub requested her to send back\\nYusuf to him she was aggrieved and said, “Let it be. I’llsend him later.”\\nThen she tied the waistband under his clothes and sent him back to his\\nfather. When Yusuf came home the aunt also accompanied him and told\\nYa‘qub that her waistband has been stolen. She began to search for it.\\nAfter rummaging here and there she lifted the garment of Yusuf and ex-\\nclaimed, “Here it is! Yusuf had stolen it.

Hence the loss of Yusuf caused me deep sorrow. I wept so\\nmuch that the pupils of my eyes turned white. Yusuf had a brother from\\nhis maternal aunt and I loved him too. When I felt nostalgic for Yusuf I\\nembraced his younger brother. It consoled me to some extent. His broth-\\ners even took him away from me because you had asked about us and\\nordered my sons to bring their younger brother to you when they come\\nto collect grains the next time. And you refused to deliver food stocks if\\nthey did not obey your request. Thus, I was compelled to send him to\\nyou for assured supply of food grain. My sons returned without the\\nyounger brother and said he had stolen the king’scup. Although we be-\\nlong to a family that does not steal, you have arrested him and caused\\nme grief due to his separation. So much so, that my back has bent. This\\ntragedy has surpassed all the calamities that befell me.\\nHence, do me a favor and release my son. And also send a greater\\nquantity of wheat. Be generous in fixing the rate of food grains and liber-\\nal in weighing.

But historians and commentators differ\\namong themselves. Some state that there was a gap of 80 years between Yusuf’s\\ndream and his reunion with Ya‘qub. It was 70 years according to others. While an-\\nother group of scholars thinks it was 40 years. Some even say it was 18 years.\\n105.According to hasan Basri, Yusuf was seven or ten years old when he was into the\\nwell. His slavery, imprisonment and rulership accounted for another 80 years. After\\nreuniting with his family he lived for another 23 years. Consequently he lived for 120\\nyears.\\n106.Some Shi‘ah traditional reports mention the period of separation to be more than\\n20 years. Another fact that emerges from the traditions is that Benjamin was not from\\nthe womb of Yusuf’s mother. He was from the womb of his mother’s sister. Accord-\\ning to interpreters when the Qur’anic verse mentions that he took father and mother\\nto the throne, it is only metaphorical. The word ‘mother’ stands for his aunt.

However, the previous view is stronger.\\n108.Thus in a reliable report when people asked Imam al-Ri€a how many sons accom-\\npanied Ya‘qub when he was reunited with Yusuf, he said, “Eleven” and when asked\\nwhether Benjamin was from the womb of Yusuf’s mother.

And this dotage almost cost Yusuf his life. Hence discrimina-\\ntion between children is not allowed especially when there is chance of creating a\\ndissension between them. The reply to this objection is Ya‘qub’s intensive love for\\nYusuf was not only because he was a son. He preferred him over other sons due to\\nhis knowledge and Prophetic status. It is also possible that Ya‘qub could not rein his\\nemotions in his love for Yusuf. Another explanation is that Ya‘qub may not have ex-\\npected his preference for Yusuf would cause jealousy to such an extent. Ya‘qub wept\\nso much for Yusuf that he became blind.

His sight had become\\nweak. Due to excessive weeping a while layer developed on the pupils and this\\nblocked his vision. Another view is that Prophets are not immune of each and every\\ndefect. Only those disabilities that people find repulsive are absent in Prophets. And\\npeople do no find blindness a repulsive quality. It should not be a cause of reducing\\ntheir Prophetic abilities. In spite of an impaired vision the Prophets could perceive\\nwith their inner eye. Thus there was no such defect in Ya‘qub. The last of the reasons\\nseem more acceptable.\\n342', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The Sunni scholars have\\nmentioned disgraceful things in interpreting this verse. One explanation says that\\nYusuf too embraced Zulaykha and would have gone ahead but he saw the face of\\nYa‘qub in the corner of the room. Ya‘qub was biting his fingers in suspense. Seeing\\nthis Yusuf felt ashamed and dropped the idea of fornication. Another report says that\\nwhen Zulaykha covered the idol with a cloth Yusuf felt ashamed. Other foolish inter-\\npretations are also mentioned in traditional books.\\n120.First Reply: The ayah says ‘he would have also made for her’. It means that if he\\nhad not been a Prophet and not seen Archangel Gabriel and the ‘manifest evidence’\\nhe would have succumbed to his desires. Since he was already a Prophet the possibil-\\nity of falling into sin did not arise for Yusuf.\\n121.Second Reply: Zulaykha ‘made for him’ for committing adultery and Yusuf ‘would\\nhave made for her’ to kill her if she forced him further. And it is possible that in that\\nshari‘ah it was allowed to kill a person who compels one to sin. The Almighty pre-\\nvented him from killing her due to hidden wisdom. The Egyptians might have re-\\nvenged her murder by executing Yusuf. Al-Ma’mun asked about the matter and\\nImam al-Ri€a said, “If Yusuf had not seen the ‘manifest evidence of his Lord’ he\\nwould have also intended what Zulaykha did. But he was infallible (Ma’soom) and a\\nMa’soom never makes an intention of committing a sin. Indeed my father has told\\nme from his father (Imam al-Sadiq ) that he said Zulaykha ‘intended’ to commit for-\\nnication and Yusuf ‘intended’ to avoid it.”\\n122.In another reliable tradition when ‘Ali bin Al-Jahm asked Imam the interpretation\\nof this ayah, Imam said, “Zulaykha intended to sin and Yusuf intended to kill her be-\\ncause his intention was very repulsive for him. But the Almighty restrained him from\\nmurder and fornication. Allah says,“thus (it was) that We might turn away from him\\nevil and indecency.” (12:24). Allah means to say that He prevented from him evil\\n(Zulaykha’s murder) and indecency (fornication).”\\n123.The two reports of Yusuf’s vision of Ya‘qub face and Zulaykha covering the idol\\ndo not contradict our first reply. Their only deficiency is that they have not elabor-\\nated. It is possible that Allah showed him the evidence so that the thought should not\\narise in his mind even though there was no possibility of it because he was already a\\nMa’soom. Some of the reports are present due to Taqiyyah.\\n124.6) Yusuf commanded his brothers to bring Benjamin with them even though he\\nknew his father would not like it. And when Benjamin was brought to Egypt he ar-\\nrested him. This made Yusuf responsible for his father’s sorrow. Also, even after be-\\ning enthroned as the king why did he not inform Ya‘qub of his well being, knowing\\nwell that he was aggrieved for him.\\n343', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In some circum-\\nstances it becomes obligatory to use Toriya. Here it was a necessity because without\\nit, the arrest of Benjamin was not possible. Therefore Yusuf said, ‘You are thieves’\\nwith the intention that they had stolen Yusuf from his father. Some people say that it\\nwas not Yusuf who passed this remark.

We have already men-\\ntioned the tradition where Imam al-Sadiq says that the Sajdah (prostration) of Ya‘qub\\nand his sons was for worshipping (thanking) Allah.\\n131.Secondly, the prostration was not that of obeisance but it was a gesture of respect\\nfor Yusuf. And in that shari‘ah it was allowed to prostrate before others as a mark of\\nhonor.\\n132.Third interpretation is that it was not a Sajdah, as we know it. It was a ritual associ-\\nated with expressing respect for someone and those people had named it ‘Sajdah’.\\n133.Nevertheless the prostration was according to Divine Command and it was inten-\\nded to manifest the superiority of Yusuf over his brothers and other people.\\n134.Lastly, when we accept the infallibility of Prophets and Imams we must know that\\nwhatever they did must have had Divine sanctions even though we may be ignorant\\nof the hidden wisdom.

However, it is difficult to ignore such a large number of tradi-\\ntions in order to accept the views of these scholars. For example, we\\nknow that many a times, Prophets and Imams are tyrannized and op-\\npressed by some people and forced to undergo untold difficulties, all this\\nis mostly due to Satanic instigation. So it is not impossible for Satan to\\nhave control of Ayyub’sfortune and physical conditions.

He comes to\\nMakkah in every hajj, performs hajj and stands in ‘Arafat and says\\n‘Amen’to the prayers of the faithful; that very soon Almighty Allah will\\nmake al-Khidhr confidante of al-Qa’im (aj) the family of Muhammad;\\nthat when he (al-Qa’im) will be hidden from the public eye he (al-\\nKhidhr) will be his companion in solitude.\\nIt is narrated with reliable evidence from Imam al-Baqir that when\\nDhu’l-Qarnaynheard that there was a stream of water of life and that\\nwhoever drinks from it remains alive until the day of blowing of the\\nbugle, he went in search of it. al-Khidhr was the commander-in-chief of\\nhis army. Dhu’l-Qarnaynloved him most. Finally, they reached a place\\nwhere there were 360 streams. Dhu’l-Qarnayncalled 360 persons from\\nhis army. al-Khidhr was one of them. All of them were given a salted fish\\nand told, “Bring them separately to me after washing it in different\\nstreams.” When al-Khidhr put his fish in the water it became alive and\\nslipped from his hands.\\nal-Khidhr took off his clothes and jumped into the water and dived\\nseveral times in search of that fish and in the process drank that water\\n455', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

But when\\nthey harvested there was no seed in it at all. Everything had become\\ngrass. They went to Musa with this complaint and narrated what had\\nhappened. Allah revealed to Musa, “I did not decide for The Israelites\\nbut allowed what they desired. Since they were not agreeable with My\\ndecision, I left them to their planning. The result is what you see.”\\nIn a reliable hadith it is recorded from Imam al-Baqir, Imam as-Sadiq\\nand Imam al-Ridha that it is written in the unexpunged Torah that Musa\\nasked his Lord, “Are you near to me with Whom I can talk softly or are\\nYou away from me with Whom I must talk loudly?” Allah revealed to\\nhim, “O Musa!

He saw a fire far away and had come there to bring fire to\\nwarm her. Secondly he was afraid of the Pharaoh. Allah said, do not fear him, you\\nare quite safe in My protection.’”\\n145.\\n146.[80] Prophet Musa came back to his wife.\\n147.\\n148.[81] There are different opinions about the fear of Musa -According to another tra-\\ndition Musa thought that people will think he is a magician like other magicians.\\nImam ‘Ali quotes Musa was waiting for Allah’s revelation. It was rather late so Musa\\nwas afraid that people would think that the Pharaoh’s magicians were true. But it is\\ndoubtful matter whether the Pharaoh killed all the magicians or not. But it is true, he\\nhanged them and cut off their hands and legs. Indeed they all were magicians and\\nunbelievers. But in their last time they became loyal and faithful to Musa According\\nto another tradition, they all were arrested and were involved in divine’s chastise-\\nment and were released with the people of The Israelites. The people said to the\\nPharaoh not to taunt them. Then they prayed to Allah to give them patience against\\nthe Pharaoh. In another tradition it is stated that the Pharaoh said to his magicians\\nthat Musa has taught them magic power and he is their leader. He said they would\\nbe hanged on the date tree and then realize whose chastisement is severe. The people\\nsaid, “Allah, the Almighty has created the world and all of us. We do not believe in\\nyou. Therefore do whatever you like. Life is very short and your order is also tem-\\nporary. We believe in Allah. Indeed He is great and we have faith, He will forgive\\nour sins you compelled us to use magic power on Prophet. But Allah is Kind and He\\nis immortal.”\\n149.\\n150.[82] There are different opinions about it. Some say that the Pharaoh wanted to\\nthreaten him and some says, he wanted to kill him. Some says it is possible that he\\nwanted to threaten him only and not to kill him.\\n151.\\n152.[83]Regarding the reason of repentance of the Pharaoh that Allah did not accept\\nhis repentance on account of final Chastisement some writer says He did not repent\\nby heart but he was pretending to save himself from divine wrath. Another writer\\nsays: He believed in Allah but he had to accept the Prophethood of Musa.\\n153.\\n487', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

How can He be seen when He does not posses either a body on an\\nenvironment or a place (space) nor can he be in any direction. Then how did Musa\\ndespite being greatest messenger put such a question before Him? This doubtful\\nquestion can be answered in two ways. First: the asking of Musa was not for seeing\\nwith the eye and that he wanted to comprehend Him and His attributes through un-\\nderstanding and that at the same time he may also attain the maximum limit of the\\nhuman understanding. Since the first wish was prohibited and the second was above\\nhis status, the lord, by shedding the particle of His greatness on the mount and by\\nmaking Musa unconscious, made it clear that no one has the strength to comprehend\\nhis grandeur and that no one has ability to of reaching the maximum of state of un-\\nderstanding because it is only for the Prophet of the last era (Muhammad saw).

If Har-\\nun had done a thing which angered Musa so much that he held his head and bread\\nand pulled toward himself and made him talk very harshly with him then Harun\\nhad committed a sin. And if he did not commit a sin then it was a sin or an error on\\nthe part of Musa to insult his brother who too was a Prophet, especially the former’s\\ngesture of throwing the tablets of Torah. Some reasons can be given for this: First:\\nwhich is most clear is that this was a dispute between two Prophets for reforming\\ntheir people and to make them repentant because when The Israelites indulged in\\nsuch a heinous sin and considered it is a light one it was necessary for Musa to ex-\\npose the evil of that deed perfectly and no way was more perfect than to deal harshly\\nwith his great brother who besides having a blood relation with him was a great mes-\\nsenger and to throw the tablets on the ground thus hinting that he had abandoned\\nthe work of reforming them and that bringing the Book to them was of no avail so\\nthat they too might realize that they had surely done a gruesome deed which became\\nthe cause of such strange happenings and which ended the patience of Musa and\\nverily Musa did not err nor he intended to harm Harun. It is a common diplomacy of\\nrulers when the near ones are being punished so that others may be warned. Allah\\nAlmighty too has, on a number occasion in Holy Qur’an, used angry words for the\\nHoly Prophet but the main aim was to discipline the Ummah as will be described\\nhereafter in the events of the Holy Prophet-Inshallah. The second reason is that these\\ngestures of Musa were due to his extreme anger against the Ummah. Just as a man\\nbites his lips or pulls his beard when very angry Musa did so to Harun who was near\\nto him like his own life. And Harun requested Musa not to do so because, he thought\\nthat The Israelites might not understand the main reason and mistake them for\\nenmity and its blame might fall on him Musa. The third reason is that he pulled the\\nhead and beard of Harun by way of love and affection so that the community would\\ndraw some other meaning out of it. So he requested him to stop doing so, so that\\nsomebody may not think bad about Musa. The fourth cause is that what Musa did to\\nHarun or the deeds of both of them were a sort of Tark al-Awla (giving up the desir-\\nable), which did not amount to a sin or disobedience, which could be contrary to\\nProphethood. Other reason also have been mentioned besides these but the first one\\nis the clearest and as regards throwing of tablets it is possible that they might have\\ndropped from his hands due to extreme anger and hence unintentionally or perhaps\\nthey were thrown to show Divine worth or toughness in religion or a refutation of\\nthe opponents and that such throwing cannot be regarded as a disrespect. It should\\nbe borne in mind that there are various and varying hadiths about Musa’s promise to\\nhis people. Most of them mention that Musa had promised that he would remain ab-\\nsent for thirty days but that the Almighty, due to some contingency, by way of Badaa\\n(novel gesture) turned that promise into that of forty days. The 30-days promise had\\na condition attached to it and that condition was not fulfilled and this appears from\\nsome verse and also some hadiths that Musa had given them a promise of 40 days\\nand it was merely due to the length of time those people did like that until Satan mis-\\nguided them so they made a count of days and nights separately and at the end of 20\\ndays they said that 40 had passed away. It is easy to connect the verse, as the Ayat is\\nnot specific that the promise was definitely of 30 days.

How can then they be messengers despite committing such a sin? Its reply\\nis possible with such causes: first: The description of their becoming messengers\\nmight have been by way of Taqiyyah because most of the Sunni (non-Shi‘ahs) have\\nrelated like that. Second: when they died their first (earlier) life with sin had ended\\nand they might have been innocent in their second life, which is sufficient for their\\nMessengership. There is scope for discussion in this cause. Third: Their asking might\\nalso have been behalf of their community and the chastisement might have been by\\nway of disciplining the community. This also appears difficult to believe. Fourth: The\\nword ‘messenger’ might have been used figuratively, that is to convey the sense that\\nafter being alive they turned pious like Prophets. But the first cause is clearer. It must\\nbe understood that this event is to give witness the truth in the belief of Raj‘ah\\n(resurrection); that as it is in this event, in the time of the al-Qa’im (al-Mahdi). Some\\nhave said that what has happened in The Israelites will happen in this Ummah also,\\nwhich will be mentioned in a following chapter-Inshallah. It should be remembered\\nthat it was according to these repeated hadiths about the repetition of what had\\nhappened in The Israelites, that the holy Prophet had told Amir al-Mu’minin that\\nyou are for me as Harun was for Musa. And in this Ummah the story of the first op-\\npressor, like that of Samiri and the calf and he was worse than the calf and the\\nsecond was more cunning than Samiri and as they did not obey Harun, these did not\\nobey the last Prophet’s rightful Legatee and when they dragged the Emir forcibly to\\nmosque so that allegiance may be obtained from him. ‘Ali facing the grave of the\\nholy Prophet addressed him as Harun had addressed Musa. And when the era of ca-\\nliphate passed away which was like that of the calf and Samiri and Qarun and when\\npeople gave allegiance to Amir al-Mu’minin, swords came out of their sheets like The\\nIsraelites and they began to kill one another. Just as The Israelites remained restless\\nin the desert of Tiyah for apparently forty years, this Ummah also will, by the com-\\nmand of Allah, due to their own selection, remain restless in their worldly and other-\\nworldly affairs until the time of al-Qa’im aale Muhammad Many things have been\\nnarrated about each of these affairs through Shi‘ah and non-Shi‘ah sources which\\nwill, Inshallah, be mentioned henceforth in their appropriate place.\\n167.\\n493', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is mentioned in yet another tradition that Imam al-Sadiq\\nsaid, In this Ummah the example (or likeness) of us (i.e.. ‘Ali and me) is like Musa\\nand al-Khi€r. When Musa met with him and talked with him he wished to remain\\nwith him. Thereafter what happened is as mentioned by Allah in the holy Qur’an\\nthat the Lord revealed to Musa that: I have made you superior to other people with\\nMy Messengership and by My talking with you. So now take up whatever I have giv-\\nen you and remain thankful to Me. He also said: We have written for Musa the de-\\nscription of everything in the tablets and have inscribed admonitions. And certainly\\nal-Khi€r did possess the knowledge which was not written in tablets for Musa and\\nMusa had imagined that all the things required by man are there in the Torah and\\nthat the tablets contained everything. It is similar to the claim of the group which\\nsays that they themselves are faqihs (jurisprudents) and scholars (Ulama) of this\\nUmmah and that everything required by this Ummah and this religion is with them\\nand that they have got it from the Prophet and they have imagined all this though\\nthey are lying. They do not know all that the Prophet knew nor have they under-\\nstood everything. There are many problems wherein they do not know what is per-\\nmissible (Halaal) and what is prohibited (haram) and they do not like that people\\nshould approach them for clarification lest they be called ignorant. This is because\\nthey do not seek knowledge from the real treasure and they interfere in Allah’s reli-\\ngion through their personal guessing. They have left the Prophetic signs and worship\\nAllah through self-made rituals even though the Messenger of Allah has said that\\nevery innovation is ignorance and deviation. Enmity towards us and jealousy has\\nprevented them from seeking knowledge from us. By Allah! Musa despite his high\\nstatus did not entertain jealousy towards al-Khi€r and his great knowledge also did\\nnot prevent him from asking questions to al-Khi€r. When Musa desired from al-\\nKhi€r that he may teach him knowledge and since al-Khi€r knew that the former did\\nnot have the patience required for his company nor was he able to observe events\\n(coolly), he told him (Musa): How can you be patient at observing those things over\\nwhich you have no power and which are beyond your circle of knowledge. Musa\\ntried with total humility to make al-Khi€r kind to him and to allow him his company.\\nSo he said, Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you in any\\nmatter. al-Khi€r did know that Musa had no strength to know those things (which he\\nwas to see) nor was he able to attain that power. Accordingly Musa did not remain\\npatient at the knowledge of that A’alim when he saw the jobs that he did not like\\nthough Allah like them. Similarly our knowledge is disliked by the ignorant but it is\\nliked by the Lord of the worlds.\\n175.\\n495', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

But an honest believer must not try to delve deep into its cause espe-\\ncially into everyone of them lest they may slip. He should from the beginning tell\\nSatan that it has been proved on the basis of sound arguments that whatever Allah\\nsays is justice and wisdom and strategy and that whatever the Messengers of Allah\\ndo is correct and appropriate even if our intelligence fails to understand some of\\ntheir special affairs. Regarding the detailed replies to doubts, the first doubt is that a\\nMessenger must be the wisest person of his time then how can it be that Musa who is\\na Messenger should need the guidance of anybody else? Its reply is that a messenger\\nmust be the most knowledgeable person of his time and al-Khi€r was a messenger of\\nAllah. Maybe he was not in the Ummah of Musa. Further the knowledge in which a\\nmessenger must not need anyone else’s help is the knowledge of religious laws and\\nrulings. There should be no objection if Allah teaches a messenger some such things\\nthrough a man as He does through an angel. So it is not to be imagined that al-Khi€r\\nwas superior to Musa if the latter needed guidance of the former in some matters. It\\nis possible that a kind of knowledge was exclusively with Musa and it was not\\nknown to al-Khi€r and vice versa as is mentioned in some reliable traditions. Se-\\ncondly how did al-Khi€r kill a boy who did not commit any crime. The reply is that\\nmaybe he had attained puberty and might have opted for Kufr. It is also possible that\\nhe might have been called a boy in the holy Qur’an as he was just entering the age of\\npuberty and hence might have drawn the punishment of killing. Above all, even if he\\nhad not become a major Allah had the right of taking back the life which He had giv-\\nen in view of some strategy (known only to Him) just as even today the angel of\\ndeath has the authority to retrieve the souls of people. But the apparent Prophets\\nhave normally been assigned (by Allah) to deal on the basis of apparent things.\\nHowever, intelligence does agree that Allah may appoint some of them (messengers)\\nwith the factual (though unseen) knowledge and that they may act according to that\\nknowledge. Thus they may kill some disbeliever on the basis of the knowledge\\nwhich they possess because it is as a matter of fact only in the interest of the one who\\nis killed not to go to Hell by committing blasphemy. Moreover it is better for others\\nalso so that they may not misguide others. The third point is that how did Musa\\nmake haste in objecting to the acts of al-Khi€r when he already knew the supremacy\\nof the former and how did he tell al-Khi€r that ‘you have committed a sin?’ The reply\\nis that possibly Musa was made responsible only for apparent (visible) knowledge\\nbecause it so happens that a deed which is a sin apparently, and as the main factual\\ncause behind it is not known to one, he abhors it. When Musa told al-Khi€r that: You\\nhave committed a Munkar (detestable deed) what he meant was that you did a thing\\nthat apparently is a Munkar. Some have said that the words of Musa were condition-\\nal to express that you have done a thing that astonishes and confuses the mind. The\\nfourth objection is that when Musa had given a promise that he would not take any\\nobjection nor ask any questions until al-Khi€r mentioned the causes, how did he\\nmake a breach of that word of promise. It reply is that it is not known for sure and\\nthat the keeping of the word was obligatory, especially when it might have been\\nbased on the Will of Allah. When he had in the beginning said Inshallah it was not\\nobligatory to keep the word under all circumstances. Hence it is no sin if it was not\\nkept..

After that, they decided that the next\\ntime there was an epidemic they would not stay in the city. When they\\nwere struck again by the epidemic they all left their houses and went to\\nanother city. The houses of that city were vacant because the people of\\nthat city had also died by an epidemic. Their dead bodies were annihil-\\nated except their bones. The people of The Israelites settled in the empty\\nhouses. Again by the order of Almighty they all died. Many years\\npassed. Once a caravan passed by the way where the bones were\\nscattered. They saw the bones lying on the way. They collected the\\nbones, kept them aside, and cleared the way for the passers-by.\\nHizqil passed this way. When he saw the human bones lying in a bad\\ncondition he grieved and wept much. He raised his hand to Allah and\\nprayed: O Allah! Make them alive again in the same way as you have\\ntaken away their lives so that the city can again be prosperous and they\\ncan increase the number of your followers and true believers. Allah was\\npleased with him and asked, “O Prophet! Do you want me to make them\\nalive?” The Prophet replied, “Yes, My Lord.” Then Allah answered his\\nprayer and Hizqil saw the scattered bones regaining their original form\\nuntil the parts of their bodies came to their original form and they were\\nalive.

Surely We made\\nthe mountains to sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at the\\nevening and the sunrise, And the birds gathered together; all joined in\\nsinging with him. And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him\\nwisdom and a clear judgment. And has there come to you the story of the\\nlitigants, when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascend-\\ning over the walls? When they entered in upon Dawud and he was\\nfrightened at them, they said, Fear not; two litigants, of whom one has\\nacted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with\\njustice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way. Surely\\nthis is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but\\nhe said, make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in dis-\\ncourse. He said, Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe\\n(to add) to his own ewes; and most surely most of the partners act\\nwrongfully towards one another, save those who believe and do good,\\nand very few are they; and Dawud was sure that We had tried him, so he\\nsought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned\\ntime after time (to Him)”.

So he (Dawud)\\nprayed to Allah, “O Lord! You praised Your Prophets but did not praise\\nme.”\\nThere came a revelation from Allah: “I praised them after I took their\\ntests and subjected them to difficulties and they showed patience over\\nit.” Dawud said, “My Lord! Take my test also, put me into troubles so\\nthat I may also show patience and reach their status.” Allah said, “Do\\nyou give preference to calamity over safety? All right, then, I had taken\\ntests of those Prophets without their knowledge. But now, I make you\\naware in advance that I will put you to test on such and such date of\\nsuch and such month of such and such year.\\nIt was a routine of Dawud that on one day he used to settle disputes of\\npeople and on the next day he secluded himself from others and en-\\ngaged in worship in solitude. When the promised day of test arrived\\nDawud made himself deeply engrossed in worship. He sat alone in the\\nMihrab and prohibited people from approaching him.\\nThe story of Uria about Dawud which is mentioned among Sunnis is a\\nfabrication of those who believe that Messengers of Allah can commit\\nsins.

People have narrated\\nsuch a hadith from Amir al-Mu’minin also.\\nOn the basis of the Shi‘ahbelief and according to the opinions of some\\nother opponent groups who believe that Prophets do not commit sins,\\nthere is a difference of opinion about the repentance of Dawud and its\\ncause and also about the trial taken by Allah of Dawud. There are some\\nreasons for this. The first is that his repentance was not due to any sin\\nbut it was merely to express meekness and humility in the presence of\\nAllah. Second, Uria had asked for the hand of a woman. Thereafter\\nDawud also asked for her hand. Uria had no wife while Dawud had\\nninety-nine.\\nTherefore, it was preferable to leave that woman for Uria (and he\\nshould not have sent a message for marriage). But he did not do so (the\\ndesirable) and hence Allah expressed His unhappiness Third: Dawud\\nhad sent Uria in a war. Thereafter he did not feel much on hearing about\\nhis martyrdom as his wife was beautiful and he married her. This too\\nwas an ugly (undesirable) deed which did not befit his status though it\\nwas not a sin. Allah sent two angels for warning him. Fourth: The two\\nwho had come to Dawud were not angels but were thieves and they had\\ngone to harm him. But since they could not gain what they wanted they\\nmade up this story to hide their misdeed and Dawud realized that they\\nwere (really) thieves and he thought of punishing them and it was his\\nimagination (no certainty) which amounted to giving up or leaving the\\ndesirable. So he repented did not do anything to the two. Fifth: Allah be-\\ncame angry because when the plaintiff made his statement, Dawud, be-\\nfore ascertaining from the defendant, declared that ‘hehas done injustice\\nto you.’His intention was that ‘Ifyou are telling the truth then he has op-\\npressed you’. The better course was that he should not have uttered\\nthese words before taking the statement of the defendant. Therefore, he\\nsought forgiveness for leaving this preferable (desired) course of action.\\nIt is recorded with reliable evidence that, in the court of Al-Ma’mun,‘Ali\\nbin Al Jahm inquired from Imam al-Ridha.\\nImam asked him, “What do your Ulama say about it?” ‘Ali bin Al\\nJahm replied, “They describe that one day Dawud was praying in his\\n555', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

That is why Lord Almighty had\\ntold Satan that “You will not gain control over My exclusive servants, except those\\nmisguided who would follow him.” Whenever Satan makes them commit a mistake\\nAllah’s Mercy at once comes to their aid and makes them do things against the de-\\nsires of the devil thereby raising their status and increasing their love for Allah as Al-\\nlah has said in case of Adam that he (Adam) disobeyed Him and strayed from the\\nright path then Allah made him a chosen one and accepted his repentance and\\nguided him toward His nearness. In this case, He says, after the error committed by\\nDawud that: We pardoned him because in our sight his nearness and status is high\\nand he turns toward us in a better way. Thereafter He made him His deputy and\\nvicegerent on earth. If one ponders over this matter somewhat deeply one can very\\nwell see the strategy behind the existence of the devil who is showing desires in\\nbeautiful (attractive) form to the human heart etc. It is quite obvious that the giving\\nup of the preferable (Tark al-Awla) on the part of Adam which resulted in his weep-\\ning for three hundred years before Allah was quite purposeful. Though, apparently,\\nhe was driven out of Paradise, he was admitted to the heavens of love and nearness\\nand recognition of the Lord consequent to his repentance and humility and weeping\\netc. Every drop of his tear created fruits in the garden of his love for the Lord. Vari-\\nous flowers grew in the his farm of realization of Allah. Every sigh of his repentance\\nproved to be a torch burning down heaps of sins and mistakes of hundreds of years.\\nHe heard the responding voice of ‘Labbaik’ in response of his each and every wailing\\n(from the court of the Almighty). He obtained eternal and everlasting happiness as a\\nreward for every repentance and gloom. Every tear dropping from his profusely\\nweeping eye turned into a shining pearl for his crown of honor and the red water\\nrunning from his eyes over his face made his status higher and higher. One of the\\nreasons or causes of man’s being superior to the angels is also that, perhaps, perfec-\\ntion is not attained without an error or leaving the preferable. It also happens that,\\n569', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

People of The Israelites were anxious\\nfor forty days and were searching for Sulayman. Sulayman walk to the\\nshore seeking Allah’sforgiveness.

(4:103)\\nImam said ‘Manqoot’means compulsory, and Wajib, this does not\\nmean that time of prayers helplessly leaves or prime time is passed and\\nprayers are recited. For then it becomes void. If it would have been so,\\nthen Sulayman ibn Dawud would have been destroyed because his pray-\\ners (in its timing) was left. (Rather it is so) that if one forgets and when\\nhe remembers it, he can recite. So ibn Babawayh after this tradition notes\\nthat the ignorant of Sunnis says that one day Sulayman was busy in ex-\\namining the horses, the sun was set, so he ordered the horses to be\\npresented. Then he cut off their necks and legs and said that these horses\\nhad made me forgetful of Allah. As they say it is not so because their lies\\nno fault of the horses because they themselves did not approach Sulay-\\nman. They were animals. And the correct reason is narrated from Imam\\nas-Sadiq that one day Sulayman was busy in inspecting the horses and\\nthe sun set so he asked angels to bring back the sun so that he recites\\nprayers on time. Then the angels brought the sun back. Sulayman\\nrubbed his head and shin of (lower legs) and necks and in his shari‘ahit\\nwas so. Then Sulayman arose and performed his Salat. When he fin-\\nished, the sun set and the stars were visible. This is what Allah has said\\nin His saying. “And he did (slash) Masah of shin and necks.”\\nSecond reason is that in both the cases it should be regarding horse\\nmeans that took the horses away until they disappeared from the eyes of\\nSulayman then he gave the orders, then they were brought. Then put his\\nhand on their mane and legs and washed their mane (long hair at the\\nback of the neck of a horse) so that, his befriending them is like jihad in\\nfront of Allah and it is very much praised worthy and it is said, “I\\nshowed love towards horses because they are with me in the remem-\\nbrance towards Allah or due to reason that I befriend them in Jihad, and\\nnot to satisfy my soul.”\\nThird reason is this that in the sun returned and in second case to-\\nwards horse. Means he inspected the horses to such extent that the sun\\nset. And due to this reason he ordered the horses to be brought back and\\ncut off their necks and legs.

Or it might be that he gave massage to\\nhorses and did not kill them rather freed them in the way of Allah so that\\nthose who wanted can take them.\\nAnd regarding Sulayman’sexamination and calamities and the flesh\\nwhich was found on his chair few reasoning are explained.\\n1st reason is that one day Sulayman was sitting on his throne and said\\nthat tonight I will meet 70 women and each will give birth to a son, who\\nwill fight in the way of Allah, but he did not say Inshallah and due to this\\nexcept one woman who became pregnant none gave birth to son and he\\nwas too deformed. That son was brought and kept on his throne. At that\\nparticular moment, Sulayman thought and it is so because he has\\ndone Tark al-Awla and had not said Inshallah and so he went to the His\\nLord and repented and started seeking forgiveness.\\nSecond reason is this that, when a son of Sulayman was born, Jinn and\\nShaitans decided that if he lives he will take from them hard work like\\nSulayman. So Sulayman was frightened that someone might torture him,\\nso he left him at a place where he was fed and received training. But one\\nday he found him dead on his throne. And so he got reprimanded that it\\nis of no use to run from destiny. And he has to face it.

So he prayed and\\ncried that Allah cure him. There are those reasoning that Shi‘ahUlama\\nand others have narrated under the interpretation of this ayah. And\\nwhatever was explained by ‘Aliibn Ibrahim was rejected. And the first\\ntwo tradition which Ibn Babawayh and Shaykh al-Tusi have narrated do\\nnot mention betrayal of Satan.

Few days remained for its completion. Sulayman entered the\\nmosque and taking support of the staff was reciting Zabur and the Shait-\\nans were busy around him.

He asked, “Who are you?” He replied, “I am\\nthe one who doesn’taccept bribe nor do I fear any King.

After consultations they agreed that he should be\\nkilled. They constructed huge pipes of lead and fixed them to the spring\\nreaching its bottom. Then they climbed down and after removing all the\\nwater and dug a well underground. After this the people caught hold of\\nthe Prophet and imprisoned him in that well. Then they closed the\\nmouth of the well with a huge boulder. They climbed up, removed the\\npipes and allowed the water to flow over the well into the spring. They\\nsaid, “Now our gods shall be pleased with us for we have killed the\\nProphet who maligned us. We have buried him at the base of the\\ngreatest Sanobar tree. Maybe now it will regain its freshness and bloom.”\\nThe whole day they heard the pleas of the Prophet buried inside. He was\\npraying to his Lord thus: “O my Lord! You are aware of my confinement\\nand see my sorrow and grief. Have mercy on my helplessness and take\\naway my soul at the earliest. Do not delay it.” Ultimately the oppressed\\nProphet met his end.

O Fatimah, Pray to Allah, prostrate and bow\\ndown in Allah’sadoration.” Even Angels were conversed with Fatimah.\\nOne night, while speaking to the Angels, Fatimah said, ‘Maryam is su-\\nperior on all the women of the world.’Angels said, ‘Maryam was super-\\nior in the period of ‘Isabut Allah the glorious has given you superiority\\nwith on all the women of the world until the day of judgment.’\\nIt is related that one day the Prophet drew four lines on the ground\\nand asked the followers, “Do you know, why I have drawn these four\\nlines?” The followers said, “No, Allah and His Prophet know better.”\\nProphet said, “These lines indicate four best ladies of the Heaven. 1)\\nKhadijah bint Khuwaylid 2) Fa§imah my daughter 3) Maryam bint\\n‘Imran 4) Aasiya Bint Mazahim, the wife of the Pharaoh.”\\n204\\n205 206\\n[129] From the ancient writings we come to know what was happen-\\ning in the past will be happen in future. Allah sent bounties from the\\nheaven for Maryam as well as for Fa§imah.\\n203.[127] It is very difficult to solve this problem. In the book Behaarul Anwaar it is in-\\ndicated that the daughters of Prophets were not having menstrual course and it will\\nbe discussed in the chapter of Fatimah. Some hadith indicates that they were having\\nmenstrual course (Qur’an says (3:42) O Maryam! Surely Allah has chosen you and\\npurified you and chose you above the women of the world.” Allah says, O Maryam!\\nKeep to obedience to your Lord and humble yourself, and bow down with those who\\nbow.”\\n204.According to Imam Musa al-Ka¨im the Holy Prophet has said that Allah has ap-\\npointed these four with all His bounties, and in all respects, above all the women of\\nthe world.

The king told him that he had\\nheard that he had worshipped his god and therefore he was his brother-\\nin-faith and so it was his duty to assist him and hence he may tell him\\n(the king) whatever he needed. He said, ‘Oking! I do not need anything\\nbut I have seen two persons imprisoned in your temple. Who are they?\\nThe king retorted that they had come to him with an intention to turn\\nhim away from his religion and to falsify his religion they invited him to\\nworship the heavenly god.” The third Messenger said, ‘Oking! It is bet-\\nter on our part to have a regular and systematic dialogue with them. If it\\nis proved that truth is with them then we may follow them and if it is es-\\ntablished that the truth is with us then they should enter our religion and\\nbecome eligible for all the relief and concessions available to us.\\nThe king agreed to this proposal and called the two from the temple.\\nWhen they arrived in the court the third messenger asked them as to\\nwhy they had come there?

Then the Qur’angoes on to\\nmention:\\n“Then we gave you back the turn to prevail against them, and aided\\nyou with wealth and children and made you a numerous band.” (15:6)\\nCommentators describe that from the side of the king of Babylon,\\nLahraasf, Nebuchadnezzar finished them off and when his son Gustaf\\ncame to throne he showed mercy towards The Israelites, released their\\ncaptives and sent them towards Syria and made Daniel their king. Then\\nThe Israelites overpowered the companions of Nebuchadnezzar. Accord-\\ning to another wording this indicates the killing of Jalut by Dawud. Wa-\\nhab has narrated that when Nebuchadnezzar surrounded The Israelites\\nand the latter could not stand against the former they turned toward Al-\\nlah and wept and did good deeds and also prevented ignorant from do-\\ning evils beside enjoining them to do good.

Perhaps some of the common among them\\nmight have been narrated by way of Taqiyyah (hiding of facts to avoid\\ntrouble). The error of Yunus was that of ‘Tarkal-Awla’(giving up the\\npreferable) and an undesirable deed, because Allah had permitted him to\\nstop preaching and had promised that chastisement would overtake\\nthem. Then it was not obligatory for him to return to his people until Al-\\nlah ordered him to preach to them again. A better course was to be kind\\nto the community despite all of its evils and to recommend their case be-\\nfore the Lord and await the Divine decision. But he did not do that. So\\nAllah, by way of discipline, raised his status by showing the marvels of\\nthe underwater world and made it like a Me’raj(ascension). His anger\\nwas against the misdeeds of the community. He was not displeased with\\nAllah Almighty. He believed that the Merciful and kind Allah would not\\nfrown on him. Other reasons have also been recorded in various tradi-\\ntions and commentaries.\\n[148] Possibly Allah might not have made it absolutely compulsory for\\nthe Messengers to accept the Wilayah of the pure Imams so that ignoring\\nit might become a sin.

In other traditions, it is clarified that they were\\nnot bankers of gold and silver but of words who knew the testing of\\ntruth and untruth.

There were 4000 pillars of gold. 1000 lamps of gold were hanging\\nby chains made of silver. The lamps burnt with the most fragrant oil.\\nThere were one thousand windows on the eastern side which allowed in\\nthe sunlight until the time of sunset.

The cursed one did not give any reply. The worshipper ap-\\nproached him again and tried to make him talk and explain how he\\ncould worship so long at a stretch. He asked the Satan what gave him\\nsuch a high status. Then the agent of Satan said, O slave of Allah! I had\\ncommitted a sin. I repented over it but always keep that sin mind.

They meant Makkah and the Ka‘bah.Tuba said, If what you\\nsay is correct then I would kill their men folk, imprison their boys and\\ndestroy their houses. At once, his eyes bulged out and hug over his face.\\nThen Ulama and the progeny of Prophets were called. He asked them to\\nthink and let him know why this trouble overtook him. They asked him:\\nFirst of all tell us what was in your mind (intention). He replied, “I had\\nintended that when I enter Makkah I will kill their men folk, capture\\ntheir children and break their house (Ka‘bah).”They at once told him\\nthat in their opinion the only reason for his trouble was this intention en-\\ntertained by him. He asked the reason. They said that city is the Haram\\n(sanctuary) of Allah and that house if the House of Allah and the resid-\\nents of that city are the progeny of Prophet Ibrahim. Tubba said, You are\\nright. Now tell me what I should do by way of repentance so that this\\ntrouble may be warded off. They said, Now decide and intend to do\\nwhat opposite of your earlier is thought so that perhaps the trouble may\\nbe removed. What they intended to convey was that he should now pay\\nrespect to Makkah and Ka‘bahand think of doing good to the residents\\nof Makkah. With this new intention, his eyes went back to their original\\nplace. He then called that group which had inspired him to destroy\\nKa‘bahand killed them all. When he reached Makkah he covered Ka‘bah\\nwith a gilaaf and gave a feast to the citizens of the holy city for 30 days.\\nEvery day 100 camels were sacrificed and its meat was put in big vessels\\nplaced in mountains for feeding the forest animals. Grass and grain was\\nprovided for four footed animals in fields and deserts. Then he came\\nfrom Makkah to Medina and made some Yemenis reside there who be-\\nlonged to the tribe of Bani Ghassaan so that they might await the arrival\\nof the Prophet of the last age.

He says that:\\nWhen Shaykh bin Shaajaan became a king called Kees he ruled for 266 years. When\\nhe completed 51 years of his regime ‘Isa arrived. When ‘Isa was raised up in the\\nheavens Shamoun bin Hamoon Shafa became his caliph. After Shamoun, Prophet-\\nhood was given by Allah to Yahya bin Zakariyya. At that time Urdeshir ibn Ashkaan\\nbecame king and he ruled for 14 years and two months. In the 8th year of his rule the\\nJews martyred Yahya. Yahya made the son of Shamoun his legatee (Wasi). After\\nArdeshir his son Shapoor became the king, ruled for 30 years and was murdered. In\\nthat period the trustee and the treasurer of the Divine knowledge and the conveyor\\nof Allah’s Messages was Shamoun who was in the progeny of Prophet Ya‘qub. The\\nDisciples (companions) of ‘Isa were with him. At that time Nebuchadnezzar became\\na king. He ruled for 187 years, killed 80 thousand persons in retaliation of the killing\\nof Yahya and it was he who destroyed Jerusalem. The Jews were fragmented and dis-\\npersed in his time to different cities. After completion of 47 years of his rule Allah\\nAlmighty appointed Uzair as a Prophet over those who had left their cities for fear of\\ndeath. Allah included Uzair also in them (he also died). A hundred years thereafter\\nAllah made him and all of them numbering 100000, alive. Then they got killed at the\\nhands of Nebuchadnezzar. After Nebuchadnezzar his son Mehrooyah became king,\\nruled for 16 years and 26 days, imprisoned Prophet Daniel in a well, dug pits, threw\\nhis (Daniel’s) companions in them and burnt them alive. They are the Makers of the\\npit who have been referred to in the holy Qur’an. Then when Allah willed to retrieve\\nthe soul of Daniel He commanded him to hand over his Divine knowledge and wis-\\ndom to his son Maleekhaa and to make him his caliph. At that time Hormuz was the\\nking. He ruled for 33 years, 3 months and 4 days. Thereafter Behram ruled for 26\\nyears. At that time the custodian of religion and shari‘ah (religious code) was\\nMaleekhaa. His companions were among the believers and testifiers. But they could\\nnot express their faith and were not able to tell the Truth openly. After Behram, his\\nson ruled for 7 years. Thereafter the chain of Prophets was broken and the age of in-\\ntermission began and the Divine Commander and leader and Legatee was\\nMaleekhaa. He had his companions with him. When the time of his death ap-\\nproached, Allah asked him to hand over the Divine Light of Wisdom to Inshoo and\\nto make him his legatee. Thereafter a number of persons in the progeny of Inshoo be-\\ncame religious leaders one after another as Allah wished. After Behram, Hormuz’s\\nson Shapoor came to throne and he ruled for 92 years. He was the first king who\\nmade a crown and adorned it on his head. At that time too the Legatee was Inshoo.\\nAfter Shapoor his brother Urdeshir ruled for 2 years. It was in his time that Allah\\nmade the Seven Sleepers alive. At that time Allah’s caliph was Inshoo’s son Wasee-\\nhaa. After Urdeshir his son Shapoor became king and ruled for 50 years. In his time\\ntoo Waseehaa was the leader of Allah’s creation. After Shapoor, his son Yezdjard\\ncame to throne and ruled for 21 years, five months and 19 days. In his time also\\nWaseehaa was the Divine caliph.

The\\npeople became ungrateful with Allah’s blessings and devalued them, they became\\nprey to Allah’s anger. They weakened religion. They left prayers and the Resurrec-\\ntion Day (Doomsday) came nearer. Religion was torn into pieces and people\\ndrowned in the darkness of ignorance and became wonderstruck with various reli-\\ngions and fell in doubt about the true path. Affairs were dispersed. Long period\\npassed since the arrivals of Prophets. Some remained on the religion of their Proph-\\nets and some became ungrateful to Allah. They became oppressive instead of thank-\\nful and obedient to Allah. Then Allah for his Messengership selected from the holy\\npious family tree, the one whom He had given the highest status over all the past\\ntribes and whom He had made the fountainhead of all holy personalities and the\\nmine of sacred souls, that is, He chose Muhammad al-Mus§afa for His Messenger-\\nship and bestowed on him His choice for Prophethood and exposed His Religion\\nfully through him so that he could decide matters with justice between His slaves\\nand fight against His enemies and He also gave all the knowledge and wisdom of all\\nthe past Prophets and their legatees.

Rather they say there were two angels whom Allah\\nhad sent on the earth for taking a test of men so that they may teach\\nthem the difference between magic and miracle and so that they may\\nkeep away from the former. They told the people that: We are not teach-\\ning this to you so that you can make it a means of earning in your world\\nand become disbeliever by adopting magic. The angels did not commit\\nany sin. They remained on earth for a long time and then went back to\\nthe heavens. And some say that the two were not angels but were two\\nresidents of Babylon who were famous for their virtues and hence were\\ncalled angles. Some others say that this behavior is not contrary to the\\nnature of angels because they have an angelic nature only up to the time\\nthey are in their original status of inerrancy and that they were no more\\nangels after Allah turned them into the form of men. It is possible that\\ntheir inerrancy had vanished. Though these statements do have weight\\nyet many hadiths contradict them. Thus they conform with the common\\npeoples and the Jewish traditions but against the belief of Shi‘ahs.Hence\\nit is better to remain noncommittal in this matter.
