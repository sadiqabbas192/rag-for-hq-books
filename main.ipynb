She screamed, and he lifted whip and hit her hand. She screamed; “O father!” Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) ran and held Umar by his neck. Then he moved him and made him fall and twisted his nose and neck and intended to kill him.

       "According to the traditions, Janabe Sulaym ibne Qays narrated that Abu Amir Al Bara ibn Adhib-al Ansari Al Khadhraji, who participated in 14 wars along with the Holy Prophet (PBUH), said:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. \"I did not think that this matter (caliphate) would pass away from Bani Hashem, and from Abul Hasan.\n",
       "2. Is he not the first person to recite prayer in the direction of your Qibla? And is he not the one who knows, better than everyone, all Ahadith and Traditions?\n",

       "4. And he is the one who has everything that people have, but people do not have merits that he has.\n",
       "5. Ali (AS) is he, and for what you kept away this (caliphate) from Him, I know it. This allegiance of yours is the first fitnah.\" (Page 14)\n",
       "\n",
       "This narration from Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays highlights the sentiments of Abu Amir Al Bara ibn Adhib-al Ansari Al Khadhraji, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) who fought in 14 battles alongside him. It expresses his surprise and disapproval at the caliphate not being given to Imam Ali (AS) after the Prophet's (PBUH) passing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The narration emphasizes several key points:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Lineage and Right to Caliphate:** Abu Amir expresses his astonishment that the caliphate was diverted from Bani Hashem, the Prophet's (PBUH) clan, and specifically from Imam Ali (AS), referred to as \"Abul Hasan.\" This suggests a belief that the Prophet's (PBUH) family had a natural or divinely ordained right to leadership.\n",
       "*   **Precedence in Islam:** He highlights Imam Ali's (AS) early embrace of Islam, noting that he was the first to pray towards the Qibla (direction of prayer). This underscores Imam Ali's (AS) dedication and commitment to Islam from its inception.\n",
       "*   **Knowledge and Authority:** Abu Amir emphasizes Imam Ali's (AS) unparalleled knowledge of the Ahadith (sayings and traditions of the Prophet) and traditions. This suggests that Imam Ali (AS) was uniquely qualified to lead the Muslim community due to his deep understanding of Islamic teachings.\n",
       "*   **Proximity to the Prophet (PBUH):** He points out Imam Ali's (AS) close relationship with the Prophet (PBUH), mentioning that he was the one assisted by Jibra'eel (Gabriel) in the bathing and shrouding of the Prophet's (PBUH) body. This highlights Imam Ali's (AS) special status and the trust placed in him by the Prophet (PBUH).\n",
       "*   **Unique Merits:** Abu Amir asserts that Imam Ali (AS) possesses all the qualities that others have, but others do not possess the unique merits that he has. This suggests that Imam Ali (AS) was superior to others in terms of virtue, knowledge, and leadership qualities.\n",
       "*   **Rejection of Imam Ali (AS) as a Fitnah:** Finally, Abu Amir states that he knows the reason why the caliphate was kept away from Imam Ali (AS) and declares the allegiance given to others as the \"first fitnah\" (trial or tribulation). This indicates his belief that the decision to exclude Imam Ali (AS) from leadership was a grave mistake that led to discord and division within the Muslim community.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, this narration reflects the perspective of a devoted companion of the Prophet (PBUH) who believed that Imam Ali (AS) was the most deserving candidate for leadership after the Prophet's (PBUH) death and that the decision to bypass him was a significant deviation from the right path."

       "\n",
       "He (AS) states that this Ummah will be divided into 73 sects, with only one destined for Paradise and the remaining 72 for Hell. This echoes the divisions that plagued the communities of Musa (AS) and Isa (AS), where only those who followed the true successors were saved.\n",
       "\n",
       "The saved sect, as described by Imam Ali (AS), is the one that follows the *wasi* of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). He (AS) emphasizes that this sect is guided, hopeful, and possesses true *Iman*. They obey commands, are agreeable and intelligent, and trust in him (AS). They recognize his (AS) rights and *Imamat*, understanding that obedience to him (AS) is compulsory according to the Book of Allah and the tradition of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). They do not become apostates and harbor no doubt, for Allah has enlightened their hearts with the knowledge of the Ahlulbayt's rights and merits.\n",
       "\n",
       "Furthermore, Imam Ali (AS) clarifies that this saved sect will not separate from the Quran, and the Quran will not separate from them until they reach the Fountain of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). They are the Ahlulbayt for whom Ibrahim (AS) prayed, as mentioned in Surah Ibrahim.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, it is crucial to understand that merely claiming love for the Ahlulbayt is not enough. Imam Ali (AS) states that even among those who profess love and devotion (*Muwaddah*) for him (AS), many will still be misguided. He (AS) says that out of 13 sects who connect themselves to the love of the Ahlulbayt, only one will reach Paradise, while the other 12 will be in Hell.\n",
       "\n",
       "The key lies in truly understanding and adhering to the *Wilayat* of the Ahlulbayt, recognizing the misguidance of their enemies, and upholding what is lawful and unlawful according to their teachings. This saved sect chooses Allah's Deen, stays away from disagreements in the Ummah, and leaves matters of uncertainty to Allah.\n",
