This is the first book of Shia and is one of the secrets of Ale-Muhammad (a.s)” Introduction BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM Wa Sallallahu ‘Ala Muhammad Wa Alahit Tayyabin al Muntakhabin And May Allah shower his blessings on the Holy Prophet (SAW) and his holy progeny who are pure and chosen ones. It is believed that Fazile Muhaddith Shaykh Shehr Ashoob Assarawi al Mazindarani, who was one of the greatest Ulamah in 565 A.H. has narrated that he read the hand written book of Sulaym ibn Qays Al Hilali to Raise Afif Abul Baqa Hibatullah ibn Nama ibn Ali ibn Hamdun (RA), in his house, in Hilla-e-Jamein in Jamadi au Awwal, 565 A.H. Raise Afif Abul Baqa Hibatullah said that he read this book in front of Shaykh Amin Alim Abu Abdillah Al-Husayn ibn Ahmed ibn Tahal al Miqdadi al-Mujawir in Mashhad of Amirul Mumineen (AS) in 520 A.H. He was informed of the book of Sheikh Mufid Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn Muhammad at-Tusi (RA), in Rajab 490 A.H., who had been informed by his father. Readers interested in tracing the chain of narrators leading to Umar ibn Uzayna are requested to refer to the book of Sulaym in Arabic. Umar ibn Uzayna said: “I was called by Aban ibn Ayyash a month before he died and he told me that he saw a dream the night before that he was soon going to die. Then he saw me and he was pleased to see me, and the night after that he saw Sulaym ibn Qays Hilali in his dream. Sulaym said to Abad: “O Aban you are going to die in these days. Fear God as far as my amanat (that which is held in custody for safe keeping) is concerned, and you do not destroy it and what you promised to hide, fulfill it. And only give it to that person who loves Ali (AS) and has Deen and reputation.” Aban then said that when he saw me he was very pleased and remembered the dream that he had about Sulaym ibn Qays. He (Aban) said: “When Hajjaj ibn Yusuf came he asked for Sulaym ibn Qays. Sulaym ran away and he came to my house. I have not seen anyone except Sulaym who had such a concern for his reputation and Sulaym always performed best deeds and feared God very much. He did not like to mingle with everybody, he preferred to remain isolated. He did not like to be famous and found publicity bad. I was 14 years at the time and had completed reciting Quran. I used to question him and he used to tell me about Ahlulbayt. I have heard a lot of ahadith from Sulaym which he narrated from Umar ibn Abi Salmah, who was the son of Janabe Umme Salmah, the lady who was one of the wives of the Holy Prophet (SAW). Sulaym also narrated to me ahadith from Ma’az ibn Jabal (a companion of the Holy Prophet (SAW), and also from Salman Farsi who narrated from Abu Talib (AS), and Abu Dhar, Miqdad, Ammar, Bara ibn Adhib. Then Sulaym requested me to keep these ahadith to myself but he did not take an oath from me in this matter. Then after a few days Sulaym passed away. He called me and, in private, he said to me: “O Aban I have spent a lot of time with you and I did not see anything in you which I did not like. I have some books that I have heard from authentic narrators and I have written them with my own hands. These books contain a lot of ahadith that I do not want you to let people know because they will deny them and will be surprised, although they are all true and that I have heard them from people who are trustworthy. Possess knowledge about Jurisprudence who do not tell lies and who do good deeds only and who have narrated from Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) and Salman Farsi, Abu Dhar Gaffari, Miqdad ibn Aswad (RA). And when I heard a hadith from one person I also asked another person regarding the same hadith until all of them agreed the same to be true. Then I accepted the hadith. There are certain things that I have not heard from people who never lied, and when I fell ill, I thought I should burn them but fearing that to be a sin, I did not want to burn them. If you promise me and take an oath that you will not show it to anyone except those whom you believe to be as trustworthy as yourself. If you face an incident then you will give it to someone from the Shia of Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) whom you trust and who is religious and reputable.”.” Aban continued: “I promised Sulaym, so Sulaym gave me everything and also read them all to me and after a few days Sulaym (RA) passed away. After sulaym died I read the ahadith and had confidence in them to be true and found them to be of the highest degree because they contained annihilation of the whole Ummah of the Holy Prophet (SAW), be they from Muhajireen, Ansar or Tabeiin except Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) and his Ahlulbaty (AS) and their Shia. Then I came to Basra and the first person that I met was Hasan ibn Abul Hasan Basari, who at the time was hiding from Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Hasan ibn Abul Hasan Basari used to declare himself as one of the very devoted shia of those times of Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) and used to show regret that he could not participate and help Ali (AS) in the Battle of Jamal, so I met him alone in the east part of the house of Abu Khalifa Al Hajjaj ibn Abu Itab Ad-Delami and read the ahadith that Sulaym had given me. Hasan cried and siad: “Whatever is in these ahadith is true. I have myself heard them from the trustworth shia of Ali (AS) and also from others.” I went for Hajj in that year and after that I went to see Hadhrat Ali ibnul Husayn (AS). At that time Abu Tufayl Aamil ibn Waasila, a companion of the Holy Prophet (SAW) was with him and Abu Tufayl was amongst the best of companions of Ali (AS). Umar ibn Abi Salmah, the son of Janabe Umme Salmah was also there. I presented these ahadith to him (Umar), Abu Tufayl and Hadhrat Ali Ibnul Husain (AS) for three days and also at night Umar and Abu Tufaul used to come to Hadhrat Ali ibnul Husain’s (AS) house to listen. I read for three days and also at night. So Hadhrat Ali (AS) told me “Sulaym (RA) has said truth. These are all our ahadith which we know.” Abu Tufayl and Umar ibn Abi Salmah said: “We have heard these ahadith from Ali (AS) and also from Salman, Abu Dhar and Miqdad.” I said to Hadhrat Ali ibnul Husain (AS): “May I be sacrificed for you, there are certain matters mentioned in these ahadith that make my chest feel tightened because there is destruction of the Ummah of the Holy Prophet (SAW) be they Muhajireen, Ansar or Tabe’iin, except for your Ahlulbayt and your Shia.” Alayhissalam said: “O brother of Abul Qays, do you not know that the Holy Prophet (SAW) has said: “The example of my Ahlulbayt in my Ummah is like the example of the boat of Noah (AS) in his community. Those who embarked the boat were saved and those who refused drowned. And it is like the door of Hittah in Bani Israel.” I said: “Yes, I know.” Ali ibn Husain (AS) asked: “Who told you this hadith?” I replied: “I have heard this hadith from more than 100 fuqaha.” Ali ibnul Husain (AS) asked: “From which people?” I replied: “From Hanash ibnil Mo’atamar, who said he had heard it from Abu Dhar when Abu Dhar was in Ka’abah and he was holding the chains of the door of Ka’abah and was loudly saying this hadith that he had heard from the Holy Prophet (SAW).” He asked: “Who else from?” I replied: “From Hasan ibn Abu Hasan Basari who had heard from Abu Dhar, Miqdad and from Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS).” He asked: “And who else from?” I replied: “From Sa’eed ibnul Musayyib and Al-Qamah ibn Qays and Abu Dhabiyan Al-Jambi, and Abdul Rahman ibn Abi Layla, and these were all in Hajj. they informed that they had heard from Abu Dhar.” Abu Tufayl and Umar Abi Salmah said: “By God, we have heard it from Abu Dhar and Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS), Salman Farsi and Miqdad.” After that Umar Abi Salmah said: “By God, I have heard it from some one who is better than all these. I have heard it from the Holy Prophet (SAW) himself. My two ears head it and my heart has remembered it.” Aban continued: “Ali ibnul Husain (AS) turned to me and asked: “Does this one hadith not contain all those things that have frightened you, and with all these hadith there is a burden in your heart? O brother, fear God. If the matter is clear for you then accept it, otherwise keep quiet, you will be safe and leave its knowledge to Allah, because then you will have broad space, a space which is between the sky and the earth.” Aban said: “I asked him concerning all those matters about which I knewe and about which I did not know. He replied to me what he wanted. After that I met Abu Tufayl in his house and he informed me about Raja‘at, the Raja’at of those who were related to the people of Badr, and Salman, Abu Dhar and Miqdad and Ubay bin Ka’aab.” Then Abu Tufayl said: “I presented what I had heard about these people to Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) in Kufa, so he said: “This is a special knowledge. If the Ummah does know it, it does not matter, and leave this knowledge to Allah.” Then he confirmed what I had been told about Raja’at was true and also recited verses from Quran relating to Raja’at and also gave satisfying commentary of the verses until I came to a stage where I believe in the Day of Judgment but I believe in Raja’at more. Among the things that I had spoken to Ali (AS) I also asked: “O Amirul Mumineen, please inform me on the Fountain of the Holy Prophet (SAW). Is it in this world or the Hereafter?” He said: “Yes, it is in this world.” I said: “Who will be the one to turn people away from it?” He replied: “I will turn people away with my these hands. My friends will come near the Fountain and my enemies will be turned away from it.” I asked: “O Amirul Mumineen, when Allah says: ’And when the word shall come to pass against them, We shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that shall wound them,’ (Surah Naml: 82) Can you explain the meaning of Daabba?” He said: “O Abu Tufayl, You leave it?” I said: “O Amirul Mumineen, may I be sacrificed for you, please tell me.” He said: “This will be a creature that will be eating, coming and going to markets, marrying women.” So I asked: “O Amirul Mumineen, who will that be?” He said: “He is a person for whom the earth has remained established. He is a person for whom the earth is at peace.” I asked: “Who is this person?” He said: “He is the person who is sidique, farooq, raaise, and Zukam.” I asked: “But who is he?” He replied: “He is the one whom Allah has: ‘and a witness from him recites it. (Surah Hud: 17) And that person who has completed knowledge of the Book ‘and whoever has knowledge of the Book (Surah Ra’d: 43) And he who has brought the truth ‘and he who brings the truth and he who accepts it as the truth. (Surah Zumar: 33) And the one who confirmed it, and the one who confirmed it is myself. At that time except for him who brought truth, and myself, all were infidels.” I (Tufayl) said: “O Amirul Mumineen, tell me his name.” He said: “I have told you his name.” O Abu Tufayl, By God, if I tell all Shia who, in war, are with me and who have obeyed me, and call me Amirul Mumineed and have accepted it to be lawful to fight along with me against my enemies, if I keep telling them for months, the truth that I know from the Book which Archangel Jibra’eel brought to the Holy Prophet (SAW), then these people will go away from me, until I will be lieft in a very small group of people who believe in truth, like you and a few Shias like you.” Tufayl said: “I was frightened and said: “O Amirul Mumineen, will I, and people like myself turn away from you, or will they remain firmly with you?” He said: “No, No, you will remain firmly with me.” Then he turned towards me and said: “Our matters are very tough and difficult. Only three types of Allah’s creation can accept them. Either an angel, who is extremely close to Allah or Prophets of high rank or those human beings whom Allah has tested.”\\n\\n[HADITH_NO: 0]')"

Lady Fatimah (AS) entered and when she saw the weak state of the \\nHoly Prophet’s (SAW) health, she got into the state of crying until tears \\nstarted rolling down her cheeks. The Holy Prophet (SAW) asked: “Why are \\nyou crying?” She replied “O Prophet of Allah after your death I am scared of \\ndestruction of myself and my children.” The Holy Prophet (SAW) with his \\neyes full of tears, said: “Oh Fatimah don’t you know? We are people of that \\nhousehold which Allah has chosen for the hereafter instead of this world and \\nHe ordained it necessary for all beings to be destroyed. And Allah Tabarak \\nwa T’ala looked at the entire beings that He created and He selected me and \\n\\n \\n \\nmade me a Nabi and a Rasul. Then He looked again and He chose your \\nhusband and commanded me to marry you to him and make him my caliph \\nof my Ummah. So your father is the best amongst all Prophets and \\nMessengers and your husband is the best amongst viziers and from all my \\nfamily you are the first one to meet me. Then He looked for the third time, \\nand He chose you and chose 11 men from your children and the children of \\nmy brother who is your husband. \\n \\nSo Oh Fatimah, you are the leader of the women of Paradise and both your \\nsons (Al Hassan and Al Husain (AS) are the the leaders of the youths of \\nParadise, and myself and my brother and the 11 Imams who are my \\nsuccessors till the Day of Judgment are all Guides, and are themselves \\nGuided. After my brother, amongst all the successors the first one is Hasan, \\nthen second is Husayn, after whom the nine are from Husayn’s children. All \\nof us will be in one place in the Paradise and there will not be any place \\nnearer to Allah than my place. \\n \\nAfter my place there will be the place of Hadhrat Ibrahim (AS) and his \\nchildren. Oh daughter, don’t you know that Allah has given you the status \\nthat you have been married to the one who is the best amongst my Ummah \\nand the best that my whole household. He is the first one in Islam, possesses \\nmost control over anger that everyone else, is the most knowledgeable and is \\nmost prestigious than anyone else and is the most truthful in tongue, is the \\nbravest in heart, most generous in hand and is the least attached to this world \\nand is the best in action. \\n \\nAfter the Holy Prophet (SAW) told the above to Lady Fatimah (AS) she was \\npleased and became happy. \\n \\nThen the Holy Prophet (SAW) said to Fatimah: “Ali has 8 very shinning \\nwonders and he has such metirs that no other human being possessed. \\n \\nHe has faith in Allah and His Prophet. \\n \\nThere was no one from my Ummah who came forward to accept faith before \\nhim. \\n \\nHe had knowledge about Allah’s Book and my Sunnah and there is no one in \\nmy Ummah, except your husband, who knows absolutely all my knowledge \\nbecause Allah has given me such a knowledge that except myself and him \\n\\n \\n \\n(Ali) no one else knows. \\n \\nHe (Allah) has not given this knowledge to Angels of messengers- He has \\ngiven the knowledge only to me. He commanded me to give that knowledge \\nto Hadhrat Ali so I did that. \\n \\nThen there is no one in my Ummah who has all my knowledge. \\nUnderstanding and Jurisprudence except Ali. O Fatimah you are his wife, his \\ntwo sons Hasan and Husayn are my grandchildren and they are also the \\nchosen ones of my Ummah. Only Ali is the one to do the command to do \\ngood and forbid evil. Allah the Exahlted and Praised has bestowed him with \\nknowledge of wisdom, and the final decision. \\n \\nOh my daughter, no doubt, we are the people of that house whom Allah has \\nbestowed seven such merits that He has not given to anyone from the \\nbeginning to the end. \\n \\nI am the leader of all Prophets and Messengers and am better than them. \\n \\nMy successor is better that all successors. \\n \\nMy vizier, after me is better than all viziers. \\n \\nAnd my martyr is better than all martyrs and his is my uncle.” (I.e. Hadrat \\nHamzah) \\n \\nLady Fatimah enquired: “Oh Prophet of Allah is he the best of martyrs from \\nthose who accompanied you in wars?” \\n \\nThe Holy Prophet replied: “No, he is the leader of martyrs from beginning to \\nend, except Prophets and their successors. Ja’afer ibn Abi Talib who \\nmigrated twice, who was martyred, has been given two wings by Allah and \\nwith his two wings he flies with Angels in Paradise. \\n \\nHasan and Husayn, who are you children, are Sibt of Ummah and they are \\nleaders of the youths of Paradise. By Him who has control of my life, The \\nGuide of this Ummah is from us, who will fill the earth with as much peace \\nand justice as there will be oppression on this earth.” \\n \\nLady Fatimah asked: “Oh Prophet of Allah, from all the names that you have \\n\\n \\n \\nmentioned who is the best of all?” \\n \\nThe Holy Prophet replied: “My brother Ali who is the best in my Ummah. \\nAnd Hamza and Ja’far are both best in my Ummah after Ali, after you and \\nafter my two sons Hasan and Husayn, and after the successors who are from \\nmy this son (pointing toward Husayn) and from the successors, there is \\nMahdi (The Guide) and he who is before him is best than him, and the first \\none is better than the last one because the first one is the Imam of the later \\nand the later one is vicegerent of the former. We ahulbayt are those for \\nwhom Allah has chose the hereafter instead of this world.” \\n \\nAfter this the Holy Prophet looked at Lady Fatimah, her husband and their \\ntwo sons and said: “Oh Salman, I say bearing Allah as witness, that I am at \\nwar with whoever is at war with these and I am at peace with whoever is at \\npeace with them. Be informed that these will all be with me in Paradise. \\n \\nThen the Holy Prophet looked at Hadhrat Ali (AS) and said: “Oh Ali, no \\ndoubt, after me you will face a lot of harshness from Quraysh, in such a \\nmanner that they will overpower you and harass you. If you find helpers to \\nfight then with those who obey you , fight with those who oppose you. If \\nyou cannot find helpers, then have patience and restrain your hands and do \\nnot let yourself be destroyed. Because, surely, your status to me is like the \\nstats that Haroon had with Musa and for you, the footsteps of Haroon are \\npresent. He (Haroon) had told his brother: “Surely the people reckoned me \\nweak and had well nigh slained me” (Surah Araf: 150)\\n\\n[HADITH_NO: 1]')"

       "From the narrations in Kitab Sulaym ibn Qays, the merits of Imam Ali (AS) are numerous and profound. Here are five, illuminated by the traditions within this esteemed collection:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **The First to Accept Islam:** Imam Ali (AS) was the first among the Ummah to embrace Islam. As Imam Ali (AS) himself states, referencing the verse \"{'And the foremost are the foremost, These are drawn nigh (to Allah)' } (Surah Waqia: 10- 11),\" no one preceded him in turning towards Allah and His Prophet (PBUH). This precedence is not merely a matter of historical record, but a testament to his unwavering faith and devotion from the earliest days of Islam.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Unmatched Knowledge and Jurisprudence:** After the passing of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), all were dependent on Imam Ali (AS) for knowledge and jurisprudence, while he remained independent of all others. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) himself imparted knowledge to Imam Ali (AS) privately, day and night, ensuring that he was deeply versed in the Book of Allah and the traditions of the Prophet (PBUH).\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Bravest in Wars and Defender of the Prophet (PBUH):** Imam Ali (AS) was always at the forefront, trusted by the Holy Prophet (PBUH) due to his virtues. No difficulty befell the Holy Prophet (PBUH), no problems arose for the Holy Prophet (PBUH) defending against bravery, conquering any fort, but Ali was always sent in forefront. He consistently risked his life to protect the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and defend the nascent Muslim community.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **The Brother, Vizier, and Successor of the Prophet (PBUH):** Allah sent a revelation to the Holy Prophet (PBUH) to make Imam Ali (AS) his brother, friend, vizier, successor, and caliph. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) declared that Imam Ali (AS) is, after him, the guardian of all believers. This appointment signifies Imam Ali's (AS) divinely ordained role in guiding the Ummah after the Prophet (PBUH).\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **The Organizer, Witness, and Guide of the Ummah:** The Holy Prophet (PBUH) said that Ali (AS) is the organizer of this Ummah and is a witness over it and is responsible for its account, and that is the greatest Sign, and is very illuminated road of truth and is Allah's Path. After the Holy Prophet (PBUH), guidance can be got from him after deviation, and through him can the light be achieved from blindness. This highlights Imam Ali's (AS) role as the guiding light for the Ummah, leading them from darkness to enlightenment."

       "According to the traditions, Janabe Sulaym ibne Qays narrated that Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) said: “The Ummah will be separated in 73 sects, of which 72 will go to Hell, and 1 will go to Heaven.\" (Page 7)\n",
       "\n",
       "According to the traditions, Janabe Sulaym ibne Qays narrated that Imam Ali (AS) said: \"From the 73, 13 will show their love towards us Ahlulbayt, from which 1 will go to Heaven and 12 will go to Hell. The sect that will be saved will be the one which is guided, which is hopeful, which has Iman, obeys command (bows his head), is agreeable and intelligent. It is he that trusts me and bows his head to my command, obeys my command, chooses to keep away from my enemy, loves me, keeps enmity with my enemy, has recognised my rights, and Imamat and has realised my obedience compulsory through the Book of Allah and the Tradtion of the Holy Prophet, and has not become an apostate, and has not doubted, because Allah has enlightened his heart with the knowledge of our rights and has recognised our merits and all this has Quran with us. We will not separate from it and it will not separate from us until we reach the Heavenly Fountain of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) as he has said: And this is the one sect, out of the 73, that will be saved from Hell and will be saved from discord, misguidance and doubts, and this, surely, is from the dwellers of Heaven and these are 70000 who will enter Heaven without being questioned. As 72 sects have chosen false Deen, and are helpers of the deen of Shaytan and have taken that deen from Shaytan and its friends. These are enemies of Allah, His Prophet, and the faithful, and will go to Hell without any reckoning (hisab). These people will be far from Allah and His Prophet – they have forgotten Allah and His Prophet, have associated partners to Allah, are idolaters and have denied Him, and except God, have worshipped others in a manner that they do not even know. They think that idolaters will go to Hell without questions. Reckoning will only be for those types of people who are in between the faithful and idolaters, and muallafatul qulub (those whose hearts can be attracted) and those who are mukhtnfah (who have a little knowledge) and those who, along with good deeds, have done bad also and are with weak faith who are confused about kufr and shirk and do not really know whether to ebar enmity and will not even choose that Path which will make them Mumin or Aarif. These people will be from Ashab-‘Aaraf. These will be those at Allah’s discretion. If Allah sends him to Hell, then that will be due to sins, and if He forgives then it will be His Mercy.” (Pages 7-8)\n",
       "\n",
       "According to the traditions, Janabe Sulaym ibne Qays narrated that Imam Ali (AS) said: \"But those who believe in Tawheed and have brought Iman on the Holy Prophet (S.A.W) but do not know our Wilayat and do not know the misguidance of our enemies, have not made halal or haram, and have chosen those things in which there is no disagreement, and which Allah commanded. In matters where there is disagreement in the Ummah, they stay away, not sure of whether it has been commanded or not – so they have not chosen to be enemy or have not made lawful or unlawful, have no knowledge and whatever difficulty they come across, they leave it to Allah. So they will be saved. This sect is in-between the faithful and idolater and majority of people are in there - myself, my brother Ali, the best of all and my best friend, and Fatimah who will be the leader of the entire women of Paradise, Hasan and Husayn and 9 Imams from the children of Husayn. We will be 14 people in one place. Allah has kept all evil away from us, and has purified us in such a manner that we deserve to be purified. These will be the guides and guided ones. I am the conveyer from Allah and each one of these are conveyors from myself and Allah ‘Azz wa Jall, and these are all the proofs of Allah Tabarak wa T’Ala over His creation and are His witnesses on His earth and are treasures of His knowledge and mines of wisdom. Whoever obeys them will have obeyed Allah and whoever disobeys will have disobeyed Allah. The earth cannot remain even for a split second until they do not remain, and without them there can be no order on the earth. They are the informers of the Deen to Ummah and are informers of lawful and unlawful and explain and the Book will be with them. They will not separate from the Book and the Book will not separate from them until they all reach the Fountain of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W). We are that ahlulbayt for whom our father Ibrahim prayed and said: {'therefore make the hearts of some people yearn towards them'} (Surah Ibrahim: 37) So particular reference has been to us, and we are those people whom Allah has meant by {'O you who believe, bow down and prostrate yourselves and serve your Lord, and do good that you may succeed. And strive hard in (the way of) Allah, (such) a striving as is due to Him; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you any hardship in religion; the faith of your father Ibrahim; He named you Muslims before and in this, that the Apostle may be a bearer of witness to you, and you may be bearers of witness to the people, therefore keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and hold fast by Allah; He is your Guardian, so what an excellent Guardian and what an excellent Helper!'} (Surah Hajj: 77-78).\" (Pages 7, 42, 54)\n",

The Christians have 72 sects, 71 will go to Hell and one will go to Heaven and it is that sect who followed Isa’s wasi, and my Ummah will have 73 sects, 72 will go to Hell and one will go to Heaven and that sect is the one that follows my wasi.” (Page 65)\n",

Jews have become 71 sects - 70 sects from them will be in Hell, 1 sect will go to Heaven and this is the one that obeyed Yush’a ibn Noon, the trustee of Musa and Christians are divided into 72 sects. 71 from them will go to Hell and 1 in Heaven and this is the one who obeyed Sham’un, the trustee of Isa (AS). This Ummah will have 73 sects - 72 from it will go to Hell and 1 will go to Heaven, and this the sect that obeyed the successor of Muhammad (SAW). (Pages 32-33)"
